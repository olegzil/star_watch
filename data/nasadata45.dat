[{"date":"2007-06-03","explanation":"Why would the shadow of a space shuttle launch plume point toward the Moon? In early 2001 during a launch of Atlantis, the Sun, Earth, Moon, and rocket were all properly aligned for this photogenic coincidence.  First, for the space shuttle's plume to cast a long shadow, the time of day must be either near sunrise or sunset.  Next, just at sunset, the shadow is the longest and extends all the way to the horizon.  Finally, during a Full Moon, the Sun and Moon are on opposite sides of the sky.  Just after sunset, for example, the Sun is slightly below the horizon, and, in the other direction, the Moon is slightly above the horizon.  Therefore, as Atlantis blasted off, just after sunset, its shadow projected away from the Sun toward the opposite horizon, where the Full Moon just happened to be.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0706/sts98plume_nasa_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Shuttle Plume Shadow Points to Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0706/sts98plume_nasa.jpg"},{"copyright":"Takayuki Yoshida","date":"2007-06-04","explanation":"Why does this starfield photograph resemble an impressionistic painting?  The effect is created not by digital trickery but by large amounts of interstellar dust.  Dust, minute globs rich in carbon and similar in size to cigarette smoke, frequently starts in the outer atmospheres of large, cool, young stars. The dust is dispersed as the star dies and grows as things stick to it in the interstellar medium.  Dense dust clouds are opaque to visible light and can completely hide background stars.  For less dense clouds, the capacity of dust to preferentially reflect blue starlight becomes important, effectively blooming the stars blue light out and marking the surrounding dust.  Nebular gas emissions, typically brightest in red light, can combine to form areas seemingly created on an artist's canvas.  Photographed above is roughly four square degrees of the nebula IC 4603 near the bright star Antares toward the constellation of Ophiuchus.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0706/ic4603_yoshida_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"IC 4603: Reflection Nebula in Ophiuchius","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0706/ic4603_yoshida.jpg"},{"copyright":"Vincent Jacques","date":"2007-06-05","explanation":"No natural clouds appear in this picture.

The above image is framed by an eerie gray sky, too far from day to be blue, too far from night to be black.  Within minutes the impromptu sky show ended.  The plane crossed the Moon.

Dione should therefore have undergone a significant amount of impacts on its leading half. But the current leading half of Dione is less cratered than the trailing half!

But this impressive picture from a small, ground-based telescope reveals a stunning amount of detail on Ganymede, a jovian moon about the same size as Earth's moon but at least 1,500 times farther away. The image was carefully constructed by combining and processing only the 409 sharpest frames from a total of 10,000 recorded at 30 frames per second by a digital camera. Ganymede's radius is about 2,600 kilometers indicating that the surface markings visible are as small as around 900 kilometers across.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0708/Ganymede_20070630_2005UT.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Astronomer's Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0708/Ganymede_20070630_2005UT.jpg"},{"copyright":"Robert\nStephan","date":"2007-08-25","explanation":"M33 is a big, beautiful spiral galaxy a mere 3 million light-years away, understandably a popular target for enthusiastic astro-imagers. Just as understandably, interfering satellite trails and airplane streaks that are becoming more common in planet Earth's busy night sky are processed out of their finished images. But Robert Stephan left these streaks in his final picture of M33, realizing that he had also recorded something relatively rare. His otherwise cosmic skyscape shows the tail of an aircraft passing overhead through his telescope's field of view. A navigational strobe light on the plane flashed across the tail at exactly the right moment. The brief illumination produced the incongruous, though remarkably sharp image.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0708/M33airplane_stephan.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Just Passing Through","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0708/M33airplane_stephan720.jpg"},{"copyright":"David Cortner","date":"2007-08-26","explanation":"This coming Tuesday, our Moon will appear to disappear.   A similar total lunar eclipse is seen above in a time lapse image captured in 2003 over North Carolina, USA.  As the Earth moves between the Moon and the Sun, the Earth's shadow fell on the moon, making it quite dark.  In the above picture the Earth's rotation, multiple exposures, and digital enhancements are used to create a time-lapse effect that dramatizes how the Moon looked as it faded out and re-appeared during the three hour lunar eclipse.  As the Earth's shadow engulfed the Moon, the lunar images became less and less bright, practically disappearing during totality.  At this time, the Moon, which normally shines by reflecting direct sunlight, shone only by sunlight refracted through the Earth's atmosphere.  The next total lunar eclipse won't be visible from Earth until February 2008.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0708/200311eclipse_cortner_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Total Lunar Eclipse Over North Carolina","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0708/200311eclipse_cortner.jpg"},{"date":"2007-08-27","explanation":"What has created this huge empty volume in the universe?  No one is yet sure, and even the extent of the estimated billion-light year void is being researched.  The void is not a hole in space like a black hole, but rather a vast region of the universe that appears to be mostly devoid of normal matter and even dark matter.  The void is still thought to contain dark energy, though, and is clearly traversable by light.   The void's existence is being postulated following scientific curiosity about how unusually cold spots came to appear on WMAP's map of cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation.   One possibility was that this CMB region was not actually very cold but light from the spot somehow became more cosmologically redshifted than normal along the way.  Other voids in the universe are known to exist, but this void appears to have an unusually large gravitational effect, and so might possibly be the largest in our entire visible universe.   Investigating this, a recent study found an unusually low number of cosmic radio sources between Earth and the CMB cold spot, which led to the inference of this giant void.  An artist's depiction of the huge cosmic void is shown above.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0708/void_nrao_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Huge Void Implicated in Distant Universe","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0708/void_nrao.jpg"},{"date":"2007-08-28","explanation":"Is there life on Mars?  Although no unambiguous evidence for indigenous life on Mars has ever been found, a more speculative question -- could some life forms survive on Mars -- has taken on a new twist.  Two planetary scientists recently speculated that were extremophile microbes to involve a mixture of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and water (H2O), these microbes might well be able survive the thin, cold, dry atmosphere on Mars.  Life that involves hydrogen peroxide does exist here on Earth, they note, and such life would be better able to absorb water on Mars. They also claim that such life would be consistent with the ambiguous results coming out from the life-detecting experiments aboard the old Viking Landers. Although such speculation is not definitive, debating possibilities for life on Mars has again proven to be fun and a magnet for media attention.   Pictured above, the Viking Lander 2 captured an unusual image of the Martian surface in 1979 sporting a thin layer of seasonal water ice.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0708/ice_viking_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Could Hydrogen Peroxide Life Survive on Mars?","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0708/ice_viking.jpg"},{"date":"2007-08-29","explanation":"Have you ever seen a gigantic jet?  They are extremely rare but tremendously powerful. Gigantic jets are a newly discovered type of lightning discharge between some thunderstorms and the Earth's ionosphere high above them.  Pictured above is one such jet caught by accident by a meteor camera in Oklahoma, USA.  The gigantic jet, at the lower left, traversed perhaps 70 kilometers in just under one second.  Clicking on the image will bring up a movie in many browsers, also visible here. Gigantic jets are much different from regular cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning. The bottoms of gigantic jets appear similar in appearance to another type cloud-to-ionosphere strike called blue jets, while the tops appear similar to upper-atmosphere red sprites. Although the mechanism and trigger that causes gigantic jets is a topic of research, it is clear that the jets reduce charge imbalance between different parts of Earth's atmosphere.  A good way to look for gigantic jets is to watch a powerful but distant thunderstorm from a clear location.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0708/jet2_smedley.wmv","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Gigantic Jets Over Oklahoma","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0708/jet2_smedley.jpg"},{"copyright":"Martin Pugh","date":"2007-08-30","explanation":"The Moon passed close to the center of Earth's shadow on August 28th. Seen best by skywatchers in western North America, and the Pacific region, the resulting total lunar eclipse was a dark one, lasting about 90 minutes. In this telescopic image taken near mid totality from Yass, NSW Australia, the 85 kilometer wide ray crater Tycho lies near the top right of the shadowed lunar surface. Of course, even during a total lunar eclipse,the Moon is not completely dark. Instead the Moon remains visible during totality, reflecting reddened light filtering into the Earth's shadow.

Though such near-infrared observations can be made by mountain-top telescopes with specialized detectors, near-infrared light has too long a wavelength to be visible to the eye. This view was recorded with a sensitive camera, HAWK-I (High Acuity, Wide field K-band Imaging), just commissioned at the Paranal Observatory in Chile.

An exposure every 4 minutes captured the Moon's position and eclipse phase, until the Moon set behind the town lights and a hill on the horizon. In fact, the sequence effectively measures the duration of the total phase of the eclipse. Around 270 BC, the Greek astronomer Aristarchus also measured the duration of lunar eclipses - though probably without the benefit of digital clocks and cameras. Still, using geometry, he devised a simple and impressively accurate way to calculate the Moon's distance, in terms of the radius of planet Earth, from the eclipse duration.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0709/Yuichi-Takasaka2.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Kalamalka Lake Eclipse","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0709/Yuichi-Takasaka2_750.jpg"}]
