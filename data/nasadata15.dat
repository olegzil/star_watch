This inner region appears much like a miniature spiral galaxy itself, complete with dust lanes and spiral arms, even though it is only a few thousand light-years across.

High velocity clouds (HVCs) of gas have been seen for decades but their origins and destinations have remained mysterious.  Recent measurements have now placed at least one of these clouds in the halo of our Milky Way Galaxy, while other measurements have determined the relative abundance of cloud elements.  Of the two clouds measured, each appears to have a chemical abundance consistent with a different origin.  One HVC has been measured to have very few heavy elements (\"low metallically\") compared to neighboring stars, while another HVC has been inferred to have a heavy element abundance more typical of neighboring stars.  Hypotheses are therefore being investigated that some HVCs are local gas remnants being pushed away from our Galaxy by supernova explosions, while other HVCs are ancient dwarf galaxy remnants falling toward our Galaxy.  The latter possibility is particularly interesting as it might help explain how our Galaxy can continue to make stars at the observed rate.

It wasn't really a new star though. A comparison with detailed skymaps revealed the amazing truth, there was a known star at that position in the sky ... its brightness had simply increased by about 70,000 times.  The star, now fondly known to variable star observers as Nova V1494 Aquilae, continued to grow brighter for several days, becoming easily visible to the unaided eye before starting to slowly fade away. Its position within the constellation is indicated on this wide-angle picture taken on December 4th, near the time it was brightest. What would cause a star to undergo such a cataclysmic change? This \"new star\" appears to be a classical nova. Classical novae are thought to be interacting binary star systems in which one of the pair is a dense, hot white dwarf. Material from the companion falls onto the surface of the white dwarf, building up until it triggers a thermonuclear blast. A stunning increase in brightness and an expanding shell of debris result - but the binary system is likely not destroyed!

In a binary system, the higher mass star will evolve faster and will eventually become a compact object - either a white dwarf star, a neutron star, or black hole.  When the lower mass star later evolves into an expansion phase, it may be so close to the compact star that its outer atmosphere actually falls onto the compact star.  Such is the case diagrammed above. Here gas from a blue giant star is shown being stripped away into an accretion disk around its compact binary companion.  Gas in the accretion disk swirls around, heats up, and eventually falls onto the compact star.  Extreme conditions frequently occur on the surface of the compact star as gas falls in, many times causing detectable X-rays, gamma-rays, or even cataclysmic novae explosions.

Their sudden disappearance 65 million years ago, along with about 70 percent of all species then living on Earth, is known as the K-T event (Cretaceous-Tertiary Mass Extinction event). Geologists and paleontologists often entertain the idea that a large asteroid or comet impacting the Earth was the culprit. In such a cosmic catastrophe, the good(!) news would be that the impact would generate firestorms, tidal waves, earthquakes, and hurricane winds. As for the bad news ... debris thrown into the atmosphere would have a serious global environmental consequences, creating extended periods of darkness, low temperatures, and acid rains - resulting in a planet-wide extinction event. In 1990, dramatic support for this theory came from cosmochemist Alan Hildebrand's revelation of a 65 million year old, 112 mile wide ring structure still detectable under layers of sediment in the Yucatan Peninsula region of Mexico. The outlines of the structure, called the Chicxulub crater (named for a local village), are visible in the above representation of gravity and magnetic field data from the region. In addition to having the right age, the crater is consistent with the impact of an asteroid of sufficient size (6 to 12 miles wide) to cause the global disruptions.

In 46 BC, Julius Caesar, pictured above in a self-decreed minted coin, created a calendar system that added one leap day every four years. Acting on advice by Alexandrian astronomer Sosigenes, Caesar did this to make up for the fact that the Earth's year is slightly more than 365 days.  In modern terms, the time it takes for the Earth to circle the Sun is slightly more than the time it takes for the Earth to rotate 365 times (with respect to the Sun -- actually we now know this takes about 365.24219 rotations). So, if calendar years contained 365 days they would drift from the actual year by about 1 day every 4 years.  Eventually July (named posthumously for Julius Caesar himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter!  By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years, the calendar year would drift much less. This Julian Calendar system was used until the year 1582 when Pope Gregory XIII added that leap days should not occur in years ending in \"00\" except if divisible by 400, providing further fine-tuning.  This Gregorian Calendar system is the one in common use today.  Therefore, even though this year 2000 ends in \"00\", it remains a leap year, and today is the added leap day. That makes today the first leap day for a centurial year since year 1600 and the second such leap day of the Gregorian Calendar.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0002/jcaesar_coin.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Julius Caesar and Leap Days","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0002/jcaesar_coin.jpg"},{"copyright":"Yuugi Kitahara","date":"2000-03-01","explanation":"M13 is one of the most prominent and best known globular clusters.

Since Earth is closer to the sun than Saturn, only Saturn's dayside is visible to Earth-bound telescopes which could never take a picture like this one. After this successful flyby two decades ago, Voyager 1 has continued outward bound and is presently humanity's most distant spacecraft. The next spacecraft to approach Saturn will be Cassini, on course to arrive in 2004.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/nightsaturn_voyager1_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Saturn At Night","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/nightsaturn_voyager1.jpg"},{"copyright":"Jerry Lodriguss","date":"2000-03-05","explanation":"The dark nebula predominant at the lower left of the above photograph is known as the Pipe Nebula.  The dark clouds, suggestively shaped like smoke rising from a pipe, are caused by absorption of background starlight by dust.  These dust clouds can be traced all the way to the Rho Ophiuchi nebular clouds on the right.  The brightest star in the field is Antares. Many types of nebula are highlighted here: the red are emission nebula, the blue are reflection nebula, and the dark are absorption nebula.

Above is an X-ray image of Abell 2142, the result of the collision of two huge clusters of galaxies, and one of the most massive objects known in the universe.  This false-color image shows a concentration of gas 50 million degrees hot near the center of the resulting cluster.  Oddly, it is the relative coldness of the gas that makes this situation particularly interesting.  The center of Abell 2142 is surrounded by gas fully twice as hot, a temperature thought to have been created by energy released during the colossal collision.  Still, since we can only see a snapshot in time, much remains unknown about how clusters of galaxies form and coalesce.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/abell2142_chandra_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Abell 2142: Clash of the Galaxy Clusters","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/abell2142_chandra.jpg"},{"date":"2000-03-07","explanation":"Tomorrow's picture: Closer to Asteroid Eros  < | Archive | Index | Search | Calendar | Glossary | Education | About APOD | >  Authors & editors: Robert Nemiroff (MTU) & Jerry Bonnell (USRA) NASA Technical Rep.: Jay Norris.

Last week's maneuvers brought NEAR to within 204 kilometers of the floating mountain's surface.  With increased resolution, NEAR's camera then documented Eros' unusual shape, craters large and small, boulders, and mysterious grooves similar to asteroid Gaspra and Martian moon Phobos.  If you could stand on Eros, you would still be too small to be visible on this recent image, which shows features as small as 20 meters across.  However, you would feel gravity only 1/1000 that on Earth, so that you could easily jump over even this large 5 kilometer wide crater.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/eros0306_near_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Nearer To Asteroid Eros","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/eros0306_near.jpg"},{"date":"2000-03-09","explanation":"Late last month another erupting filament lifted off the active solar surface and blasted this enormous bubble of magnetic plasma into space. Direct light from the sun is blocked in this picture of the event with the sun's relative position and size indicated by a white half circle at bottom center. The field of view extends 2 million kilometers or more from the solar surface. While hints of these explosive events, called coronal mass ejections or CMEs, were discovered by spacecraft in the early 70s this dramatic image is part of a detailed record of this CME's development from the presently operating SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft.  Near the minimum of the solar activity cycle CMEs occur about once a week, but as we approach solar maximum rates of two or more per day are anticipated. Though this CME was clearly not headed for Earth, strong CMEs are seen to profoundly influence space weather, and those directed toward our planet and can have serious effects.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/febcme_sohoc2_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Sun Storm: A Coronal Mass Ejection","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/febcme_sohoc2.jpg"},{"copyright":"Steve Sumner","date":"2000-03-10","explanation":"On February 10th, an evocative evening sky above Rocklin, California, USA inspired astrophotographer Steve Sumner to record this remarkable sight - five planets and the Moon. Near its first quarter phase, the bright Moon was intentionally overexposed but Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury (and, of course, planet Earth's horizon) are all clearly visible in the deepening twilight. Notably absent in this grouping of naked-eye planets is Venus which is still putting in an early appearance as the morning star. This month, Mercury has joined Venus in the dawn twilight while Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars still shine brightly in the western sky at nightfall making another gorgeous close grouping with the crescent Moon.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/febplanets_ssumner_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Sky and Planets","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/febplanets_ssumner.jpg"},{"copyright":"P. Gitto","date":"2000-03-11","explanation":"Gripped by an astronomical spring fever, it's once again time for many amateur stargazers to embark on a Messier Marathon! The Vernal Equinox occurs March 20, marking the first day of Spring for the Northern Hemisphere. It also marks a favorable celestial situation for potentially viewing all the objects in 18th century French astronomer Charles Messier's catalog in one glorious dusk to dawn observing run. This year a bright full moon will interfere with dark skies near the actual equinox, so good nights near new moon for weekend marathoners are March 11/12 and April 1/2. (As an added bonus all the planets in the solar system can be viewed on these dates.) Astronomer Paul Gitto has created this masterful Messier Marathon grid with 11 rows and 10 columns of Messier catalog objects. In numerical order, the grid begins with M1, the Crab Nebula, at upper left and ends with M110, a small elliptical galaxy in Andromeda (lower right). Gitto's images were made with a digital camera and a 10-inch diameter reflecting telescope.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/messmara_gitto_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Messier Marathon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/messmara_gitto.jpg"}]
