Mars, the red planet named for the Roman god of war, has two tiny moons, Phobos and Deimos, whose names are derived from the Greek for Fear and Panic.

The larger moon, Phobos, is indeed seen to be a cratered, asteroid-like object in this stunning color image from the Mars Express spacecraft, recorded at a resolution of about seven meters per pixel. But Phobos orbits so close to Mars - about 5,800 kilometers above the surface compared to 400,000 kilometers for our Moon - that gravitational tidal forces are dragging it down. In 100 million years or so it will likely crash into the surface or be shattered by stress caused by the relentless tidal forces, the debris forming a ring around Mars.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0612/phobos_hiresme_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Phobos: Doomed Moon of Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0612/phobos_hiresme.jpg"},{"date":"2006-12-04","explanation":"Plumes of hot gas shoot across the surface on even an average day on the Sun.

Recent X-ray data and images of Kepler's supernova remnant taken by the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory has shown relative elemental abundances more typical of a Type Ia supernova, indicating that the progenitor was a white dwarf star that exploded when it accreted too much material and went over Chandrasekhar's limit.

When the sky is clear, a green flash just above the sun's edge can sometimes be seen for a second or so, when the sun is close to a distant horizon. Still, from a site atop Mt.

The mostly empty pillars are thought to be an indication that star formation actually peaked millions of years ago within the Eagle Nebula.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0702/m16composite_chandra.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"X-rays and the Eagle Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0702/m16composite_chandra720c.jpg"},{"date":"2007-02-25","explanation":"Does this moon look familiar? Possibly not, even though it is Earth's Moon.  Locked in synchronous rotation, the Moon always presents its well-known near side to Earth.  But from lunar orbit, Apollo astronauts also grew to know the Moon's far side.  This sharp picture from Apollo 16's mapping camera shows the eastern edge of the familiar near side (top) and the strange and heavily cratered far side of the Moon.  Surprisingly, the rough and battered surface of the far side looks very different from the near side which is covered with smooth dark lunar maria.  The likely explanation is that the far side crust is thicker, making it harder for molten material from the interior to flow to the surface and form the smooth maria.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0702/farside_apollo16_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Far Side of the Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0702/farside_apollo16.jpg"},{"copyright":"Robert H.

The answer to last week's sky mystery turned out to be orbiting and expanding debris from the upper stage of a failed Russian rocket that exploded unexpectedly.  The cloud became visible to unaided southern hemisphere observers, and its cause was initially unknown. The above time lapse movie shows the cloud drifting as seen from Australia.  Streaks in and near the cloud are likely large pieces of debris.  The debris cloud is more than an astronomical curiosity -- particles from this cloud and others could become projectiles damaging existing satellites.   As the cloud disperses, many particles will fall to Earth, but many more may help make low Earth orbit an increasingly hostile environment.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0702/debrismovie_mcnaught_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Rocket Debris Cloud Drifts","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0702/debrismovie_mcnaught.jpg"},{"date":"2007-02-27","explanation":"Do extrasolar planets have water?  In an attempt to find out, the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope made detailed observations of the atmospheres of two planets that orbit stars other than our Sun.  Unfortunately, water vapor was not detected in either exoplanet. Spitzer watched star systems HD 209458b and HD 189733b closely in infrared light both before and after the parent stars eclipsed their known planets.   By comparing eclipsed and uneclipsed spectra very closely, astronomers could deduce bright light-emitting atmospheric gasses that were being blocked during eclipse.   Were water vapor one of these atmospheric gases, a new indication that life might exist outside of our Solar System would have been found.   The planets being analyzed are known as hot Jupiters -- they have sizes close to Jupiter but orbits closer to the distance of Mercury. The above illustration shows an artist's depiction of one of these dry worlds. Although no water vapor was detected this time, the techniques of measuring exoplanet atmospheres are quite promising, and the search for distant water and other biomarkers is just beginning.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0702/planetatm_spitzer_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Atmospheres Detected for Two Extrasolar Planets","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0702/planetatm_spitzer.jpg"},{"copyright":"Russell Croman","date":"2007-02-28","explanation":"When stars form, pandemonium reigns.  A textbook case is the star forming region NGC 2170.  Visible above are red glowing emission nebulas of hydrogen, blue  reflection nebulas of dust, dark absorption nebulas of dust, and the stars that formed from them.  The first massive stars formed from the dense gas will emit energetic light and winds that erode, fragment, and sculpt their birthplace.  And then they explode.  The resulting morass is often as beautiful as it is complex.  After tens of millions of years, the dust boils away, the gas gets swept away, and all that is left is a naked open cluster of stars.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0702/ngc2170_croman_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Stars, Dust and Nebula in NGC 2170","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0702/ngc2170_croman.jpg"},{"date":"2007-03-01","explanation":"Panels on ESA's Rosetta spacecraft appear in the foreground of this intriguing image of Mars recorded on February 25 at a range of about 1,000 kilometers.

Below the comet-chasing spacecraft lies a dark boundary along the martian Syrtis region. But wait ... who took the picture? The picture was actually captured by the imaging system (CIVA) onboard Rosetta's lander, Philae, switched on for testing.

For example, skywatchers in Europe, Africa, and western Asia will be able to see the entire spectacle of the Moon gliding through Earth's shadow, but in eastern North America the Moon will rise already in its total eclipse phase. Of course if you traveled to the Moon's near side, you could see the same event as a solar eclipse, with the disk of our fair planet Earth completely blocking out the Sun. For a moon-based observer's view, graphic artist Hana Gartstein (Haifa, Israel) offers this composite illustration. In the cropped version of her picture, an Apollo 17 image of Earth is surrounded with a red-tinted haze as sunlight streams through the planet's dusty atmosphere. Earth's night side remains faintly visible, still illuminated by the dark, reddened Moon, but the disk of the Earth would appear almost four times the size of the Sun's disk, so the faint corona surrounding the Sun would be largely obscured. At the upper left, the Sun itself is just disappearing behind the Earth's limb.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0703/tsemoon_Gartstein_f.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Solar Eclipse from the Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0703/tsemoon_Gartstein_720cropped.jpg"},{"date":"2007-03-03","explanation":"A million miles from planet Earth, last weekend the STEREO B spacecraft found itself in the shadow of the Moon. So, looking toward the Sun, extreme ultraviolet cameras onboard STEREO B were able to record a stunning movie of a lunar transit (aka solar eclipse), as the Moon tracked across the solar disk. Each frame of the movie is a false-color composite of images made through four different filters that highlight temperature regimes and structures in the upper solar atmosphere. In this frame, large bright active regions, seen as dark sunspots in visible light, flank the Moon's silhouetted disk. The Moon appears small, less than 1/4th the size seen from Earth, because the spacecraft-Moon separation is over four times the Earth-Moon distance. Tonight, the Moon will find itself in planet Earth's shadow in a total lunar eclipse.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0703/transit_label_med4.mov","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Lunar Transit from STEREO","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0703/transit_still1_stereo.jpg"}]
