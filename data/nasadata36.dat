If trailing the Sun, Mercury will be visible low on the horizon for only a short while after sunset.  If leading the Sun, Mercury will be visible only shortly before sunrise.  So at certain times of the year an informed skygazer with a little determination can usually pick Mercury out from a site with an clear horizon.  Above, a lot of determination has been combined with a little digital trickery to show Mercury's successive positions during March of 2004.  Each picture was taken from the same location in Leeds, England exactly 33 minutes after sunset.

Such accretion disks power bright x-ray sources within our own galaxy. They form in binary star systems which consist of a donor star (not shown above), supplying the accreting material, and a compact object whose strong gravity ultimately draws the material towards its surface. For known x-ray binary systems the size of the accretion disk itself might fall somewhere between the diameter of the Sun (about 1,400,000 kilometers) and the diameter of the Moon's orbit (800,000 kilometers).

But researchers now suggest that the Milky Way's most famous black hole, Cygnus X-1, was born when a massive star collapsed -- without any supernova explosion at all. Their dynamical evidence is summarized in this color image of a gorgeous region in Cygnus, showing Cyg X-1 and a cluster of massive stars (yellow circles) known as Cygnus OB3. Arrows compare the measured direction and speed of Cyg X-1 and the average direction and speed of the massive stars of Cyg OB3. The similar motions indicate that Cyg X-1's progenitor star was itself a cluster member and that its path was not altered at all when it became a black hole. In contrast, if Cyg X-1 were born in a violent supernova it would have likely received a fierce kick, changing its course. If not a supernova, could the formation of the Cyg X-1 black hole have produced a dark gamma-ray burst in the Milky Way?","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0504/CygX1_mirabel_labfull.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Cyg X-1: Can Black Holes Form in the Dark?","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0504/CygX1_mirabel_labc2.jpg"},{"date":"2005-04-03","explanation":"What causes this unusual structure near the center of our Galaxy?

One possible answer is that Mz3 is hiding a second, dimmer star that orbits close in to the bright star.  A competing hypothesis holds that the central star's own spin and magnetic field are channeling the gas.

Three different wavelengths were used: approximately 1 centimeter, 3.5 centimeters, and 13 centimeters.  The results are coded into the above false-color digitally reconstructed image. In the above image, the color purple indicates regions populated predominantly by ring particles larger than 5 centimeters, while the color green indicates regions with a significant population of small ring particles less than even 1 centimeter.  The white center of Saturn's B-ring indicates that the density of ring particles was too high to make a good determination.

The impressive nature and clarity of the above sharp image may help determine clues about the origin of Saturn's beautiful but enigmatic ring system.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0505/radiosaturn_cassini_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Particle Sizes in Saturn's Rings","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0505/radiosaturn_cassini.jpg"},{"copyright":"Dean Jacobsen","date":"2005-05-26","explanation":"The beautiful Trifid Nebula (aka M20), a photogenic study in cosmic contrasts, lies about 5,000 light-years away toward the nebula rich constellation Sagittarius. A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy, the Trifid fittingly illustrates three basic types of astronomical nebulae; red emission nebulae dominated by light from hydrogen atoms, blue reflection nebulae produced by dust reflecting starlight, and dark absorption nebulae where dense dust clouds appear in silhouette. The bright red emission nebula, roughly separated into three parts by obscuring dust lanes, lends the Trifid its popular name. In this gorgeous wide view, the red emission region is also surrounded by the telltale blue haze of reflection nebulae. Light-year long pillars and jets sculpted by newborn stars - visible here below the center of the emission nebula - appear in Hubble Space Telescope close-up images of the region.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0505/m20_jacobsen_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Beautiful Trifid","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0505/m20_jacobsen_f41.jpg"},{"date":"2005-05-27","explanation":"Titan's odd spot could be a cloud, but if so, it's a persistent one. Peering into the thick, hazy atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon, cameras on board the Cassini spacecraft found a bright spot at the same location during Titan encounters in 2005 and 2004. Seen near Titan's upper edge in this false-color image from the VIMS instrument, the spot is almost 500 kilometers wide, and is brightest at infrared wavelengths. In addition to suggesting the uniquely colored spot is a persistent cloud possibly controlled by surface features, researchers also entertain the idea that the spot is caused by unusual surface material or extremely tall mountains. They also note the bright infrared spot could be hot. Further clues to the odd spot's nature will come during a planned encounter in July 2006 when Cassini's cameras will look at the spot during Titan's night. If it glows at night, it's hot.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0505/titanspot_cassini_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Titan's Odd Spot","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0505/titanspot_cassini_c.jpg"},{"date":"2005-05-28","explanation":"This stunning aerial view shows the rugged snow covered peaks of a Himalayan mountain range in Nepal.

Instead it was taken with a 35mm camera and telephoto lens by the Expedition 1 crew aboard the International Space Station -- orbiting 200 nautical miles above the Earth. The Himalayan mountains were created by crustal plate tectonics on planet Earth some 70 million years ago, as the Indian plate began a collision with the Eurasian plate.

Recent wide field images and analyses now indicate that our home galaxy is actually still in the process of devouring one of its closer satellite neighbors.  This unfortunate neighbor, the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy, is now seen to be part of a larger Sagittarius Tidal Stream, a loose filament of stars, gas, and possibly dark matter that entangles the Milky Way.  An artist's depiction of the stream is shown above.  Speculation also holds that the Sagittarius Dwarf was once pulled through the Milky Way disk very close to our Sun's current location.  An important resulting realization is that galaxies contain a jumble of clumps and filaments of both dim and dark matter.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0309/sag_dmd_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Sagittarius Dwarf Tidal Stream","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0309/sag_dmd.jpg"},{"date":"2005-05-30","explanation":"What caused this great white spot on the surface of Saturn's moon Rhea?  The spot was first noticed last year by the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn.  Cassini's flyby of Rhea in April imaged in the spot in great detail.  Astronomers hypothesize that the light-colored spot is the result of a relatively recent impact on the surface of the icy moon.  The impact that likely created the crater also splashed light-colored material from the interior onto the darker surface.

Also known as M20, this photogenic nebula is visible  with good binoculars towards the constellation of Sagittarius. The energetic processes of star formation create not only the colors but the chaos.  The red-glowing gas results from high-energy starlight striking interstellar hydrogen gas.  The dark dust filaments that lace M20 were created in the atmospheres of cool giant stars and in the debris from supernovae explosions.  Which bright young stars light up the blue reflection nebula is still being investigated.  The light from M20 we see today left perhaps 3000 years ago, although the exact distance remains unknown.

Interpreting x-ray data from the Chandra Observatory astronomers argue that the stars' already impressively short orbital period is steadily getting shorter as the stars spiral closer together. Even though they are separated by about 80,000 kilometers (the Earth-Moon distance is 400,000 kilometers) the two stars are therefore destined to merge. Depicted in this artist's vision, the death spiral of the remarkable J0806 system is a consequence of Einstein's theory of General Relativity that predicts the white dwarf stars will lose their orbital energy by generating gravity waves. In fact, J0806 could be one of the brightest sources of gravitational waves in our galaxy, directly detectable by future space-based gravity wave instruments.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0506/wd_cxc_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"White Dwarf Star Spiral","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0506/wd_cxc_c33.jpg"},{"date":"2005-06-02","explanation":"Carinae, one of the most massive and unstable stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, has a profound effect on its environment.

Glowing brightly in planet Earth's southern sky, the expansive Eta Carinae Nebula is a mere 10,000 light-years distant. Still, this remarkable cosmic vista is largely obscured by nebular dust and only revealed here in penetrating infrared light by the Spitzer Space Telescope.

It takes light about 1000 years to reach us from M27,  shown above, digitally sharpened, in three standard colors.
