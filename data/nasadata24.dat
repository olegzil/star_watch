What do neutrons have to do with water? As cosmic rays from interplanetary space penetrate the thin martian atmosphere and reach the surface they interact with elements in the upper layer of soil, scattering neutrons back into space. But if the martian soil contains hydrogen, it seriously absorbs energetic scattered neutrons. Tracking variations in absorption, neutron detectors can map changes in surface hydrogen content from orbit. Hydrogen content is taken as a surrogate measure of frozen water (H20), the most likely form of hydrogen close to the martian surface. Blue shades in the above map correspond to large concentrations of hydrogen, indicating in particular that the martian south polar region has a high amount of water ice near the surface.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/nmars_odyssey_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Neutron Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/nmars_odyssey.jpg"},{"date":"2002-03-16","explanation":"Do you recognize the Earth's Moon when you see it?

Recent pictures and evidence, however, indicate that lenticulars can be both photogenic and scientifically interesting.  For example, the above image of NGC 2787 taken with the Hubble Space Telescope shows that the center of this lenticular galaxy has interesting structure.  The image was taken to help determine how lenticular galaxies formed, and what happens in their centers.

Also known as Barnard 72, the Snake Nebula is a series of dark absorption clouds made up of molecular gas and interstellar dust.  Interstellar dust grains - composed predominantly of carbon - absorb visible starlight and reradiate much of it in the infrared.  This absorption causes stars behind the clouds to be obscured from view, hence the appearance of starless voids on the sky.  Molecular clouds like the Snake Nebula are places where new stars are likely to form.

Its evolved red giant stars are readily apparent in this gorgeous three-color image.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/ngc2266_credner_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 2266: Old Cluster in the New General Catalog","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/ngc2266_credner.jpg"},{"date":"2002-06-02","explanation":"Which way to the interstate?  What appears to be a caricature of a complex highway system on Earth is actually a system of ridges and cracks on the icy surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.  The distance between parallel ridges in the above photograph is typically about 1 kilometer.  The complexity of the cracks and ridges tell a story of Europa's past that is mostly undecipherable -- planetary geologists try to understand just the general origin of the overall features. One noteworthy feature is the overall white sheen, possibly indicating the presence of frost.  Another is the dark centers between parallel ridges, which might indicate that dirty water from an underground ocean recently welled up in the cracks and froze.  Recent research indicates that enough carbon exists to support an underwater biosphere, but that Europa's ice crust may be over three kilometers thick in some places.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/europafrost_gal_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Cracks and Ridges on Europa","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/europafrost_gal.jpg"},{"copyright":"Suprime-Cam","date":"2002-06-03","explanation":"Why are huge clouds of gas billowing from spiral galaxy NGC 4388?  The extent of the gas clouds, over 100,000 light-years, was unexpected before the Subaru Telescope took the above image.  NGC 4388 has a bright energetic nucleus and so is classified as an active galaxy.  The spiral, relatively close by at 60 million light years, is a member of the nearest major cluster of galaxies: the Virgo Cluster.  One hypothesis holds that the gas was stripped away as NGC 4388 made its way through the  intergalactic medium of the Virgo Cluster. A competing hypothesis holds that the gas is all that remains of a smaller galaxy that was gravitationally deconstructed by the larger NGC 4388.  Further observations may better determine NGC 4388's past and likely contribute to a better understanding of how galaxies evolve inside massive clusters.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/ngc4388_subaru_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Galaxy NGC 4388 Expels Huge Gas Cloud","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/ngc4388_subaru.jpg"},{"date":"2002-06-04","explanation":"Is it an Escher, or Mars?  Three different types of surfaces visible in the North Polar Cap of Mars morph into each other in a way perhaps reminiscent of the works of M. C. Escher.  On the far left dark sand covers the ground, while the center shows a transition to a dune field.  On the far right a transition is made to a much lighter surface, likely containing a larger amount of ice.  Shadows indicate that lighter material holds the higher ground, with some steep cliffs on the divide.  Dune shapes indicate that wind typically blows toward the upper left.  Mars Global Surveyor, one of two robot spacecraft currently orbiting Mars, took the above image in early 2001.  Recent images from the other orbiter, Mars Odyssey, have bolstered the hypothesis that a significant amount of water-ice lies beneath the surface near the Martian South Pole.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/marsmorph_mgs_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Martian Metamorphosis","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/marsmorph_mgs.jpg"},{"date":"2002-06-05","explanation":"Far beyond the local group of galaxies lies NGC 3621, some 22 million light-years away. Found in the serpentine southern constellation Hydra, the loose spiral arms of this gorgeous island universe are loaded with luminous young star clusters and dark dust lanes. Still, for earthbound astronomers NGC 3621 is not just another pretty face-on spiral galaxy. Some of its brighter stars have been used as standard candles to establish important estimates of extragalactic distances and the scale of the Universe. This color picture was constructed from astronomical image data recorded with the Very Large Telescope Antu, at Paranal Observatory in Chile.  At the original resolution, individual, hot supergiant stars can be identified and studied across NGC 3621.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/ngc3621_bresolin_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 3621: Far Beyond the Local Group","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/ngc3621_bresolin_c2.jpg"},{"date":"2002-06-06","explanation":"After astronauts repaired NICMOS - the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer - during the latest Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission, astronomers were quick to turn the sophisticated instrument on the photogenic stellar nursery known as the Cone Nebula. This remarkable NICMOS close-up of the Cone Nebula dramatically confirms that the Hubble's infrared vision has been restored. Gas and dust clouds at the blunted tip of the cone-shaped star-forming region are seen here in false-color covering an area about half a light-year across. Toward the left hand side of the picture, the four bright stars with diffraction spikes are also present in visible light images and are in front of the Cone Nebula, itself 2,500 light-years away. But the fainter stars to their right are embedded in or behind the nebula's obscuring dust clouds and are revealed only in this penetrating infrared view.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/ircone_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Cone Nebula Infrared Close-Up","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/ircone_hst_c2.jpg"},{"date":"2002-06-07","explanation":"This infant solar system was discovered posing along the lonely outskirts of the Rho Ophiuchi dark cloud, a star forming region 500 light-years from Earth. Enlarged in an infrared false-color portrait from the European Southern Observatory's Antu telescope, the dark dusty disk of planet-forming material lies edge-on, neatly dividing two small nebulae which reflect light from a hidden, youthful central star. Enthusiastically nicknamed the \"Flying Saucer\", the circumstellar disk is about 300 astronomical units across (1 a.u. is the Earth-Sun distance) or about 5 times the diameter of Neptune's orbit. The twin reflection nebulae have clearly different colors for reasons which still remain a mystery, but the relatively isolated neighborhood of the natal solar system is a stroke of luck. Planets should be able to develop within the dusty disk free from the destructive influence of radiation and winds from any nearby massive hot stars usually found in young star clusters.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/irdisk_eso_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Portrait of an Infant Solar System","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/irdisk_eso_c1.jpg"},{"copyright":"Olivier Staiger","date":"2002-06-08","explanation":"A lunar eclipse can be viewed in a leisurely fashion. Visible to anyone on the night side of planet Earth (weather permitting), totality often lasts an hour or so as the moon glides through the Earth's shadow. But a solar eclipse is more fleeting. Totality can last a few minutes only for those fortunate enough to stand in the path of the Moon's shadow as it races across the Earth's surface. For the April 29, 1995 annular solar eclipse, photographer Olivier Staiger was standing in Macara, Ecuador under partially cloudy skies. Just before the maximum annular eclipse phase he recorded this dramatic moment as a bird flew near the sun. The next solar eclipse, on June 10, will also be an annular one. Partial phases will be visible from eastern Asia, the Pacific Ocean and much of North America. Very accurate predictions of eclipses have long been possible.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/eclipsebird_staiger.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Fleeting Eclipse","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0206/eclipsebird_staiger.jpg"}]
