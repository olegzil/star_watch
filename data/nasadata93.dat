The reason here is that ice crystals in distant cirrus clouds are acting like little floating prisms.  Sometimes known as a fire rainbow for its flame-like appearance, a circumhorizon arc lies parallel to the horizon. For a circumhorizontal arc to be visible, the Sun must be at least 58 degrees high in a sky where cirrus clouds are present.  Furthermore, the numerous, flat, hexagonal ice-crystals that compose the cirrus cloud must be aligned horizontally to properly refract sunlight in a collectively similar manner.  Therefore, circumhorizontal arcs are quite unusual to see.  This circumhorizon display was photographed through a polarized lens above Dublin, Ohio in 2009.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1905/circumhorizontalarc_sladoje_2304.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Circumhorizontal Arc Over Ohio","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1905/circumhorizontalarc_sladoje_960.jpg"},{"date":"2019-05-20","explanation":"How does your favorite planet spin?

The featured video animates NASA images of all eight planets in our Solar System to show them spinning side-by-side for an easy comparison. In the time-lapse video, a day on Earth -- one Earth rotation -- takes just a few seconds.  Jupiter rotates the fastest, while Venus spins not only the slowest (can you see it?), but backwards.  The inner rocky planets, across the top, most certainly underwent dramatic spin-altering collisions during the early days of the Solar System.

Blue stars are hot and red stars are cool so that astronomical color index ranging from bluer to redder follows the relative stellar temperature scale from left (hot) to right (cool). In M13's HR diagram, the stars clearly fall into distinct groups. The broad swath extending diagonally from the bottom right is the cluster's main sequence. A sharp turn toward the upper right hand corner follows the red giant branch while the blue giants are found grouped in the upper left. Formed at the same time, at first M13's stars were all located along the main sequence by mass, lower mass stars at the lower right. Over time higher mass stars have evolved off the main sequence into red, then blue giants and beyond. In fact, the position of the turn-off from the main sequence to the red giant branch indicates the cluster's age at about 12 billion years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1906/M13_and_HR_diag_updated6.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Colors and Magnitudes of M13","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1906/M13_and_HR_diag_updated6_1024.jpg"},{"copyright":"Bruce Waddington","date":"2019-06-14","explanation":"These two mighty galaxies are pulling each other apart.

They will probably collide again and again over the next billion years until they coalesce to form a single galaxy.

There is a new theory.  Ahuna Mons is the largest mountain on the largest known asteroid in our Solar System, Ceres, which orbits our Sun in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Ahuna Mons, though, is like nothing that humanity has ever seen before. For one thing, its slopes are garnished not with old craters but young vertical streaks.  The new hypothesis, based on numerous gravity measurements, holds that a bubble of mud rose from deep within the dwarf planet and pushed through the icy surface at a weak point rich in reflective salt -- and then froze.  The bright streaks are thought to be similar to other recently surfaced material such as visible in Ceres' famous bright spots.  The featured double-height digital image was constructed from surface maps taken of Ceres in 2016 by the robotic Dawn mission.

Our galaxy's black hole, though, is relatively quiet compared to the absorption rate of the central black holes in active galaxies.

Darkness descends more quickly in a total eclipse than during sunset, but returns just as quickly -- and perhaps unexpectedly  to the avians -- just a few minutes later. Stories about the unusual behavior of birds during eclipses have been told for centuries, but bird reactions were recorded and studied systematically by citizen scientists participating in an eBird project during the total solar eclipse that crossed the USA in 2017 August.  Although some unusual behaviors were observed, many observers noted birds acting like it was dusk and either landing or flying low to the ground.  Radar confirmed a significant decrease in high-flying birds and insects during and just after totality.  Conversely, several sightings of normally nocturnal birds were reported.  Pictured, a flock of birds in La Serena, Chile flew through the air together during the total solar eclipse that crossed South America last week. The photographer captured the scene in frames from an eclipse video.

Known as exoplanets, this milestone was passed last month, as recorded by NASA's Exoplanet Archive. The featured video highlights these exoplanets in sound and light, starting chronologically from the first confirmed detection in 1992.  The entire night sky is first shown compressed with the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy making a giant U.  Exoplanets detected by slight jiggles in their parents-star's colors (radial velocity) appear in pink, while those detected by slight dips in their parent star's brightness (transit) are shown in purple. Further, those exoplanets imaged directly appear in orange, while those detected by gravitationally magnifying the light of a background star (microlensing) are shown in green.  The faster a planet orbits its parent star, the higher the accompanying tone played. The retired Kepler satellite has discovered about half of these first 4000 exoplanets in just one region of the sky, while the new TESS mission is on track to find even more, all over the sky, orbiting the brightest nearby stars.

Cataloged as G292.0+1.8, this young supernova remnant is about 20,000 light-years distant toward the southern constellation Centaurus. Light from the inital supernova explosion reached Earth an estimated 1,600 years ago. Bluish colors highlight filaments of the mulitmillion degree gas which are exceptionally rich in Oxygen, Neon, and Magnesium. This enriching supernova also produced a pulsar in its aftermath, a rotating neutron star remnant of the collapsed stellar core. The stunning image was released as part of the 20th anniversary celebration of the Chandra X-ray Observatory.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1908/g292chandra.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Elements in the Aftermath","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1908/g292chandra.jpg"},{"copyright":"Don Goldman","date":"2019-08-02","explanation":"A small constellation hiding near the south celestial pole, The Chamaeleon boasts no bright stars.

In the language of cosmologists, a large cosmological constant -- dark energy -- was directly implied by new distant supernova observations.  Suggestions of a cosmological constant were not new -- they have existed since the advent of modern relativistic cosmology. Such claims were not usually popular with astronomers, though, because dark energy was so unlike known universe components, because dark energy's abundance appeared limited by other observations, and because less-strange cosmologies without a significant amount of dark energy had previously done well in explaining the data. What was exceptional here was the seemingly direct and reliable method of the observations and the good reputations of the scientists conducting the investigations. Over the two decades, independent teams of astronomers have continued to accumulate data that appears to confirm the existence of dark energy and the unsettling result of a presently accelerating universe. In 2011, the team leaders were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work.  The featured picture of a supernova that occurred in 1994 on the outskirts of a spiral galaxy was taken by one of these collaborations.

One astrophotographer did just that -- but it took a lake and a bit of planning. Realizing that the eclipse would be low on the horizon, he looked for a suitable place along the thin swath of South America that would see, for a few minutes, the Moon completely block the Sun, both directly and in reflection.  The day before totality, he visited an Argentine lake called La Cuesta Del Viento (The Slope of the Wind) and, despite its name, found so little wind that the lake looked like a mirror.  Perfect.  Returning the day of the eclipse, though, there was a strong breeze  churning up the water -- enough to ruin the eclipse reflection shot.  Despair. But wait!  Strangely, about an hour before totality, the wind died down.  This calmness may have been related to the eclipse itself, because eclipsed ground heats the air less and reduces the amount rising warm air -- which can dampen and even change the wind direction.  The eclipse came, his tripod and camera were ready, and so was the lake. The featured image of this double-eclipse came from a single exposure lasting just one fifteenth of a second. Soon after totality, the winds returned and the water again became choppy.

Since galaxies are so spread out over the sky, and since our Milky Way Galaxy blocks part of the distant sky, it has been hard to tell.

The featured map, spanning over 600 million light years on a side, shows that our Milky Way Galaxy is on the edge of the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies, which is connected to the Great Attractor -- an even larger grouping of galaxies. Also nearby are the massive Coma Cluster and the extensive Perseus-Pisces Supercluster. Conversely, we are also on the edge of huge region nearly empty of galaxies known as the Local Void.  The repulsive push by the Local Void combined with the gravitational pull toward the elevated galaxy density on the other side of the sky explains part of the mysteriously high speed our Galaxy has relative to the cosmic microwave background -- but not all.

Along the way, as these two large galaxies duel, a cosmic bridge of stars, gas, and dust currently stretches over 75,000 light-years and joins them.  The bridge itself is strong evidence that these two immense star systems have passed close to each other and experienced violent tides induced by mutual gravity. As further evidence, the face-on spiral galaxy on the right, also known as NGC 3808A, exhibits many young blue star clusters produced in a burst of star formation. The twisted edge-on spiral on the left (NGC 3808B) seems to be wrapped in the material bridging the galaxies and surrounded by a curious polar ring. Together, the system is known as Arp 87 and morphologically classified, technically, as peculiar. While such interactions are drawn out over billions of years, repeated close passages should ultimately result in the death of one galaxy in the sense that only one galaxy will eventually result. Although this scenario does look peculiar, galactic mergers are thought to be common, with Arp 87 representing a stage in this inevitable process. The Arp 87 pair are about 300 million light-years distant toward the constellation Leo.
