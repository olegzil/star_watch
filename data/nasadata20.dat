Surviving relics are older than any Earth fossil, older than any other structures in our Galaxy, and limit the universe itself in raw age.  There are few, if any, young globular clusters in our Milky Way Galaxy because conditions are not ripe for more to form.  Things are different next door, however, in the neighboring LMC galaxy.

At Tempe's latitude the Sun rises at an angle, arcing southward as it climbs above the horizon.

As a precaution against the unknown physiological effects of spaceflight on piloting skills and judgement, his onboard controls were locked out by a secret combination. In case of emergency he carried the combination in a sealed envelope. After reentry, Gagarin ejected from the Vostok at an altitude of 20,000 feet and parachuted to Earth.

Coupled with other accomplishments, this flight confirmed the early Soviet lead in the space race -- the first US astronaut would not be launched until almost a month later and then on a comparatively short suborbital flight. Born on March 9, 1934, Gagarin was an air force jet pilot before being chosen for the first group of cosmonauts in 1960. As a result of his historic flight he became an international hero and legend.

In a new twist to this solar neutrino saga, an analysis of data from the GALLEX / GNO neutrino detector finds a solar neutrino flux that varies over about 27 days ... approximately matching the Sun's rotation period. In fact, since different parts of the Sun rotate at different rates, the neutrino flux variations match most exactly the rotation rates of the areas shown in red on this colorful cross-sectional map of the solar interior rotation. So how could solar rotation affect the neutrino flux? Some theoretical models say that neutrinos can change quantum properties when they interact with tangled solar magnetic fields and become particles that the neutrino experiments were not designed to detect.

As indicated, the first picture, taken September 28, 2000, finds Venus close to the western horizon and drifting south (left) with the passing days. By December however, Venus was climbing well above the horizon after sunset and in January 2001 it reached its maximum apparent distance (elongation) from the Sun. March found Venus falling from the evening sky while moving rapidly north, finally appearing (far right) as a faint dot against the sunset glow on March 24. This month, Venus rises before dawn as the brilliant morning star.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/venusloop_tezel_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Venus' Evening Loop","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/venusloop_tezel_ann.jpg"},{"date":"2001-06-02","explanation":"In the Summer of 1054 A.D. Chinese astronomers reported that a star in the constellation of Taurus suddenly became as bright as the full Moon. Fading slowly, it remained visible for over a year. It is now understood that a spectacular supernova explosion - the detonation of a massive star whose remains are now visible as the Crab Nebula- was responsible for the apparition. The core of the star collapsed to form a rotating neutron star or pulsar, one of the most exotic objects known to modern astronomers. Like a cosmic lighthouse, the rotating Crab pulsar generates beams of radio, visible, x-ray and gamma-ray energy which, as the name suggests, produce pulses as they sweep across our view. Using a stunning series of visible light images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 1995, astronomers have discovered spectacular pulsar powered motions within the Crab nebula. Highlights of this HST Crab \"movie\" show wisps of material moving away from the pulsar at half the speed of light, a scintillating halo, and an intense knot of emission dancing, sprite-like, above the pulsar's pole. Only 10 kilometers wide but more massive than the sun, the pulsar's energy drives the dynamics and emission of the nebula itself which is more than 10 light-years across.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/crab_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Pulsar Powered Crab","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/crab_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2001-06-03","explanation":"Last March, telescopic instruments in Earth and space tracked a tremendous explosion that occurred across the universe.  A nearly unprecedented symphony of international observations began abruptly on 2000 March 1 when Earth-orbiting RXTE, Sun-orbiting Ulysses, and asteroid-orbiting NEAR all detected a 10-second burst of high-frequency gamma radiation.  Within 48 hours astronomers using the 2.5-meter Nordic Optical Telescope chimed in with the observation of a middle-frequency optical counterpart that was soon confirmed with the 3.5-meter Calar Alto Telescope in Spain.  By the next day the explosion was picked up in low-frequency radio waves by the by the European IRAM 30-meter dish in Spain, and then by the VLA telescopes in the US.   The Japanese 8-meter Subaru Telescope interrupted a maiden engineering test to trumpet in infrared observations.  Major telescopes across the globe soon began playing along as GRB 000301C came into view, detailing unusual behavior.  The Hubble Space Telescope captured the above image and was the first to obtain an accurate distance to the explosion, placing it near redshift 2, most of the way across the visible universe.  The Keck II Telescope in Hawaii quickly confirmed and refined the redshift.  Even today, no one is sure what type of explosion this was.  Unusual features of the light curve are still being studied, and no host galaxy appears near the position of this explosion.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/grb000301c_hst_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A GRB 000301C Symphony","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0003/grb000301c_hst.gif"},{"date":"2001-06-04","explanation":"What did the Sun look like before there were planets?  A prototype laboratory for the formation of low mass stars like our Sun is the T Tauri system, one of the brighter star systems toward the constellation of Taurus.  In young systems, gravity causes a gas cloud to condense.  The situation then usually becomes quite complex, as some of the infalling gas is heated so much by collisions that it is immediately expelled as an outgoing wind.  Complex geometries including jets and disks form as the infalling and outflowing gas collide and interact with a changing magnetic field. Pictured above is a false-color image of the T Tauri system itself, which turns out to be a binary.  In a few million years, the central condensate will likely become hot enough to ignite nuclear fusion, by which time much of the surrounding circumstellar material will either have fallen in or have been driven off by the stellar wind.  At that time, a new star will shine.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/ttauri_cfht.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The T Tauri Star Forming System","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/ttauri_cfht.jpg"},{"date":"2001-06-05","explanation":"Orbiting the Sun between Mars and Earth, asteroid 433 Eros was visited by the robot spacecraft NEAR-Shoemaker in 2000 February.   High-resolution surface measurements made by NEAR's Laser Rangefinder (NLR) have been combined into the above visualization based on the derived 3D model of the tumbling space rock. NEAR allowed scientists to discover that Eros is a single solid body, that its composition is nearly uniform, and that it formed during the early years of our Solar System.  Mysteries remain, however, including why some rocks on the surface have disintegrated.  On 2001 February 12, the NEAR mission drew to a dramatic close as it was crash landed onto the asteroid's surface, surviving well enough to return an analysis of the composition of the surface regolith.  Unless re-awakened by NASA, NEAR will likely remain on the asteroid for billions of years as a monument to human ingenuity at the turn of the third millennium.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/erosreconstruct_near_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Asteroid Eros Reconstructed","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/erosreconstruct_near.jpg"},{"date":"2001-06-06","explanation":"This spectacular color picture of the core of barred spiral galaxy NGC 1512 (bottom panel) is a composite of the seven Hubble Space Telescope images arrayed along the top.

At distance of a mere 8 million light-years, NGC 253's prodigious starforming activity has been well studied using high-resolution optical images like the one seen here at lower left. Zooming in on this energetic galaxy's central region, Chandra's x-ray detectors reveal hidden details indicated in the inset at right. In the false-color image, x-ray hot gas clouds glow near the core and at least four very powerful x-ray sources lie within 3,000 light-years of the center of the galaxy. Much more luminous than black hole binary star systems in our own galaxy, these extreme x-ray sources may be gravitating toward NGC 253's center. As a result, NGC 253 and other similar starforming galaxies could ultimately develop a single, central, supermassive black hole, transforming their cores into quasars.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/n253_xrayopt_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 253: X-Ray Zoom","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/n253_xrayopt_c1.jpg"},{"copyright":"Robert Gendler","date":"2001-06-08","explanation":"This intriguing trio of galaxies is sometimes called the NGC 5985/Draco Group and so (quite reasonably) is located in the northern constellation Draco.
