Shown above, the Bumper 2 was an ambitious two-stage rocket program that topped a V-2 missile base with a WAC Corporal rocket.  The upper stage was able to reach then-record altitudes of almost 400 kilometers, higher than even modern Space Shuttles fly today.  Launched under the direction of the General Electric Company, the Bumper 2 was used primarily for testing rocket systems and for research on the upper atmosphere.  Bumper 2 rockets carried small payloads that allowed them to measure attributes including air temperature and cosmic ray impacts.  Seven years later, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I and Sputnik II, the first  satellites into Earth orbit.

That gas was likely thrown off from the star, possibly by its fast rotation, like a rotating lawn sprinkler.  Expelled material might have been further channeled by the magnetic field of the star, creating the symmetric shape of the bipolar nebula.

Many disk galaxies are actually just as thin as NGC 5866, pictured above, but are not seen edge-on from our vantage point.  One galaxy that is situated edge-on is our own Milky Way Galaxy.  Classified as a lenticular galaxy, NGC 5866 has numerous and complex dust lanes appearing dark and red, while many of the bright stars in the disk give it a more blue underlying hue.  The blue disk of young stars can be seen extending past the dust in the extremely thin galactic plane, while the bulge in the disk center appears tinged more orange from the older and redder stars that likely exist there. Although similar in mass to our Milky Way Galaxy, light takes about 60,000 years to cross NGC 5866, about 30 percent less than light takes to cross our own Galaxy.

Sometimes it looks like the Sun is being viewed through a large lens.  In the above case, however, there are actually millions of lenses: ice crystals.

As these crystals flutter to the ground, much time is spent with their faces flat, parallel to the ground.  An observer may pass through the same plane as many of the falling ice crystals near sunrise or sunset.  During this alignment, each crystal can act like a miniature lens, refracting sunlight into our view and creating phenomena like parhelia, the technical term for sundogs.

In December of 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt spent about 75 hours on the Moon, while colleague Ronald Evans orbited overhead. The crew returned with 110 kilograms of rock and soil samples, more than from any of the other lunar landing sites. Cernan and Schmitt are still the last to walk (or drive) on the Moon.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/a17anaglyph_vanMeijgaarden_f.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Apollo 17: VIP Site Anaglyph","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/a17anaglyph_vanMeijgaarden_c34.jpg"},{"date":"2006-08-27","explanation":"Big, beautiful, barred spiral galaxy NGC 1300 lies some 70 million light-years away on the banks of the constellation Eridanus. This Hubble Space Telescope composite view of the gorgeous island universe is one of the largest Hubble images ever made of a complete galaxy. NGC 1300 spans over 100,000 light-years and the Hubble image reveals striking details of the galaxy's dominant central bar and majestic spiral arms. In fact, on close inspection the nucleus of this classic barred spiral itself shows a remarkable region of spiral structure about 3,000 light-years across. Unlike other spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way, NGC 1300 is not presently known to have a massive central black hole.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/ngc1300_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Barred Spiral Galaxy NGC 1300","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/ngc1300_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2006-08-28","explanation":"How many planets are in the Solar System?  This popular question now has a new formal answer according the International Astronomical Union (IAU): eight.  Last week, the IAU voted on a new definition for planet and Pluto did not make the cut.  Rather, Pluto was re-classified as a dwarf planet and is considered as a prototype for a new category of trans-Neptunian objects.  The eight planets now recognized by the IAU are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.  Solar System objects now classified as dwarf planets are: Ceres, Pluto, and the currently unnamed 2003 UB313.  Planets, by the new IAU definition, must be in orbit around the sun, be nearly spherical, and must have cleared the neighborhood around their orbits.  The demotion of Pluto to dwarf planet status is a source of continuing dissent and controversy in the astronomical community.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/planets_iau_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Eight Planets and New Solar System Designations","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/planets_iau.jpg"},{"date":"2006-08-29","explanation":"It's the blue wisp near the bottom that's the remnant of a tremendous recent supernova explosion.  The large pink structure looming to the upper right is part of N76, a large star forming region in our neighboring Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy.   The supernova remnant wisp, with full coordinate name 1E0102.2-7219 and frequently abbreviated as E0102, also lies in the SMC, about 50 light years away from N76.   The above image is a composite of several images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.  E0102 is of research interest because we see it as it appeared only 2,000 years after its explosion.  Examination of E0102 therefore gives clues about how an enigmatic supernova works and what materials it dispersed into the surrounding interstellar medium.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/e0102_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Supernova Remnant E0102 from Hubble","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/e0102_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2006-08-30","explanation":"Why is sunspot 905 backwards?  Perhaps it is a key marker for the beginning of a new magnetic cycle on our Sun.  Every 11 years, our Sun goes through a magnetic cycle, at the end of which its overall magnetic orientation is reversed.   An 11-year solar cycle has been observed for hundreds of years by noting peaks and valleys in the average number of sunspots. Just now, the Sun is near Solar Minimum, and likely to start a long progression toward the most active time, called Solar Maximum, in about 5.5 years.  An indicator that the sun's magnetic field is reversing is the appearance of sunspots with the reverse magnetic polarity than normal.  A few weeks ago, one small candidate reverse sunspot was sighted but faded quickly.  Now, however, a larger sunspot with negative polarity is being tracked.  This sunspot, numbered 905, appears as the unusual white spot in the above magnetic image of the Sun taken with the SOHO spacecraft a few days ago.   In the past few days, Sunspot 905 has actually begun to break apart and might also become the source of coronal mass ejections and explosive solar flares. Solar astronomers predict that the coming Solar Maximum will be unusually active.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/reversesunspot_soho_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Backward Sunspot and the New Solar Cycle","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/reversesunspot_soho.jpg"},{"copyright":"2006 Astr.

The most striking is clearly NGC 3718, a warped spiral galaxy found near picture center. NGC 3718's faint spiral arms look twisted and extended, its bright central region crossed by obscuring dust lanes. A mere 150 thousand light-years to the right is another large spiral galaxy, NGC 3729. The two are likely interacting gravitationally, accounting for the peculiar appearance of NGC 3718. While this galaxy pair lies about 52 million light-years away, the remarkable Hickson Group 56 can also be seen clustered just below NGC 3718. Hickson Group 56 consists of five interacting galaxies and lies over 400 million light-years away.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/n3718final_block_f.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Extra Galaxies","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/n3718final_block_c35.jpg"},{"copyright":"Elke Schulz","date":"2006-09-01","explanation":"Stars seem to arc through southern skies in this surrealistic time exposure -- recorded before moonrise from the Gemini South Observatory, Cerro Pachon, Chile, Planet Earth.
