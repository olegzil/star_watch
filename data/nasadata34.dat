But this remarkable series of images, false-color composites of x-ray and optical data, zooms in on the galaxy's fate.

In the centers of active galaxies, supermassive black holes at least thousands of times the mass of our Sun dominate.  Many, called Seyfert Type I, are very bright in visible light.  Others, called Seyfert Type II, are rather dim.  The difference might be caused by some black holes accreting much more matter than others.  Alternatively, the black holes in the center of Seyfert Type II galaxies might be obscured by a surrounding torus.  To help choose between these competing hypotheses, the nearby Seyfert II galaxy NGC 4388 has been observed in X-ray light recently by many recent Earth-orbiting X-ray observatories, including CGRO, SIGMA, BeppoSAX, INTEGRAL, Chandra, and XMM-Newton.  Recent data from INTEGRAL and XMM-Newton have found that the X-ray flux in some X-ray colors varies rapidly, while flux in other X-ray colors is quite steady.  The constant flux and apparent absorption of very specific X-ray colors by cool iron together give evidence that the central black hole in NGC 4388 is seen through a thick torus composed of molecular gas and dust.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0409/bhtorus_esa.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Molecular Torus Surrounds Black Hole","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0409/bhtorus_esa_big.jpg"},{"copyright":"Robert Gendler","date":"2004-09-09","explanation":"These three bright nebulae are often featured in telescopic tours of the constellation Sagittarius and the view toward the center of our Milky Way galaxy.

The short answer is no, even though the image was made with light visible to the human eye.

A magnet this strong, located at about half the distance to the Moon would easily erase your credit cards and suck pens out of your pocket. In 1998, from a distance of about 20,000 light-years, one magnetar, SGR 1900+14 generated a powerful flash of gamma-rays detected by many spacecraft. That blast of high-energy radiation is now known to have had a measurable effect on Earth's ionosphere. At the surface of the magnetar, its powerful magnetic field is thought to buckle and shift the neutron star crust generating the intense high-energy flares","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0411/magnetars_cobeloc_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Magnetars In The Sky","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0411/magnetars_cobeloc.jpg"},{"copyright":"Adam Block","date":"2004-11-27","explanation":"This gorgeous island universe, cataloged as NGC 2683, lies a mere 16 million light-years distant in the northern constellation Lynx.

But no one knows when - it may be next year, it may be one million years from now.  Eta Carinae's mass - about 100 times greater than our Sun - makes it an excellent candidate for a full blown supernova. Historical records do show that about 150 years ago Eta Carinae underwent an unusual outburst that made it one of the brightest stars in the southern sky.  Eta Carinae, in the Keyhole Nebula, is the only star currently thought to emit natural LASER light.  This image, taken in 1996, resulted from sophisticated image-processing procedures designed to bring out new details in the unusual nebula that surrounds this rogue star.  Now clearly visible are two distinct lobes, a hot central region, and strange radial streaks.  The lobes are filled with lanes of gas and dust which absorb the blue and ultraviolet light emitted near the center.  The streaks remain unexplained. Will these clues tell us how the nebula was formed?  Will they better indicate when Eta Carinae will explode?","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0204/etacarinae3_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Doomed Star Eta Carinae","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0204/etacarinae3_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2004-11-29","explanation":"Tethys is one of the larger and closer moons of Saturn.  The Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn passed near the frozen moon at the end of October, capturing the most detailed images since the Voyager spacecrafts in the early 1980s.  Tethys is composed almost completely of water ice and shows a large impact crater that nearly circles the moon. Because this crater did not disrupt the moon, Tethys is hypothesized to be at least partly liquid in its past.  Two smaller moons, Telesto and Calypso, orbit Saturn just ahead of and behind Tethys.  Giovanni Cassini discovered Tethys in 1684.   The Cassini spacecraft is scheduled for a close fly-by of Tethys in September 2005.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0412/tethys_cassini_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Saturn's Moon Tethys from Cassini","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0412/tethys_cassini.jpg"},{"date":"2004-11-30","explanation":"What are those strange clouds stretching out from these lakes?  The clouds are caused by cold air moving over a warm water and result in bands of lake-effect snow.  The rising bands of moistened, warmed air that drop lake-effect snow alternate with clear bands of falling cold air.  During a winter, such bands can create hundreds of centimeters of snow more than upwind areas only a hundred kilometers away.  During this lake-effect snowfall of 2000 December 5, practically all of the state of Michigan, USA got covered.  A cold northwesterly wind over Great Lakes Superior and Michigan created the unusual clouds.

Recent and likely future images of this unusual moon by the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn might help us find out.  The above image was taken at the end of October from a distance of about one million kilometers. The bright streaks run across some of Dione's many craters, indicating that the process that created them occurred later than the impacts that created those craters.  Dione is made of mostly water ice but its relatively high density indicates that it contains much rock inside.  Giovanni Cassini discovered Dione in 1684.  The Cassini spacecraft is scheduled to photograph Dione at higher resolution in mid-December.  Currently, the highest resolution images of Dione remain those taken by the passing Voyager spacecraft in 1980.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0412/dione_cassini_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Saturn's Moon Dione from Cassini","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0412/dione_cassini.jpg"},{"date":"2004-12-02","explanation":"Caught in sunlight, icy moon Mimas shines above a broad shadow across gas giant Saturn. In this remarkable image from the Cassini spacecraft, tiny Mimas is at the upper right. The broad shadow across the giant planet is cast by Saturn's dense B ring with intriguing threadlike shadows from Saturn's inner C ring arrayed below. While the B and C rings are otherwise not visible here, the very narrow outer F ring lies toward the bottom of the image as well as a section of the partly transparent A ring and its 300 kilometer wide Encke gap crisscrossing the ring shadows. Sunlight streaming through the much larger Cassini gap that separates the A and B rings is responsible for the bright band seen above Mimas. The Cassini gap itself is just off the bottom of this cropped view.

But all the stars in dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18 are much younger. In fact, based on Hubble Space Telescope image data, that galaxy's first stars formed only about 500 million years ago, making it the youngest known galaxy.  In this view, the bright knots are the two major star forming regions of I Zwicky 18, embedded in expanding filaments of glowing interstellar gas. Scattered, much older background galaxies are seen as small red blobs, and a companion galaxy lies just beyond the upper right corner of the cropped picture. Astronomers believe that diminutive I Zwicky 18 resembles the earliest galaxies formed, but also want to understand how such a young galaxy can be only 45 million light-years away - surrounded by mature galaxies in an aging Universe.

Above, the star Merope lies just off the upper left edge of this picture from the Hubble Space Telescope.  The cloud, known as IC 349, and the star have been in existence for millions of years.  In the past 100,000 years, however, part of the cloud has by chance moved so close to the star - only 3,500 times the Earth-Sun distance - that the starlight itself is having a very dramatic effect. Pressure of the star's light significantly repels the dust in the reflection nebula with smaller dust particles being repelled more strongly.  Eventually parts of the dust cloud have become stratified and point toward Merope, with the closest particles being the most massive and so the least affected by the radiation pressure.  A longer-term result will be the general destruction of the dust by the energetic starlight.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0412/merope_hst_rfull.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Reflecting Merope","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0412/merope_hst_rc25.jpg"}]
