A large meteor impacted the Martian surface to form the crater.  Conventional wisdom holds that the markings inside the crater are placed by chance by natural processes. The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft currently orbiting Mars took the above picture.

If the two regions pass close enough and in just the right way, however, an X-ray bright S-shaped region called a sigmoid forms and quickly explodes in a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME).

Brown dwarfs and planets are likely quite abundant, but usually difficult to see in the glare of brighter stars they orbit.

The impact theory of lunar origin can explain, for example, why Moon rocks returned by the Apollo missions have the same isotopic ratios as Earth rocks while the Moon seems deficient in heavy elements like iron. It can also explain a critical finding of the Lunar Prospector experiments - that the Moon's core is proportionally very small. If the Moon formed simply as a \"sister world\", its origin paralleling Earth's formation from the primordial solar nebula, it should have similar iron content and relative core size. But material blasted from the surface of Earth by an impacting body would lack the iron and heavy elements which had settled to the Earth's core yet retain similar ratios of chemical isotopes.

Kepler was one of the few vocal supporters of Galileo's discoveries and the Copernican system of planets orbiting the Sun instead of the Earth.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/kepler_hist_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Kepler Discovers How Planets Move","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/kepler_hist.gif"},{"date":"1999-06-07","explanation":"Tremendous pillars of gas and dust are being boiled away in the Trifid Nebula. In the center of the picturesque Trifid lies a young hot star, located above and to the right of this picture.  As soon as it was born, the massive star scorched its surroundings with bright and energetic light.  Nearby stars trying to form ended up starved for gas as it was swept away from them by the bright star's light and wind.  Lower mass stars should continue to form in the Trifid Nebula, as over 1500 times the mass of  our Sun still exists in uncondensed gas.  Also known as M20, the Trifid Nebula is about 9000 light years away and easily visible with a small telescope in the constellation of Sagittarius.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9906/trifid_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Starbirth in the Trifid Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9906/trifid_hst.jpg"},{"date":"1999-06-08","explanation":"Dust pillars are like interstellar mountains.  They survive because they are more dense than their surroundings, but they are being slowly eroded away by a hostile environment.  Visible in the above picture is the end of a huge gas and dust pillar in the Trifid Nebula, punctuated by a smaller pillar pointing up and an unusual jet pointing to the left.  The pink dots are newly formed low-mass stars. A star near the small pillar's end is slowly being stripped of its accreting gas by radiation from a tremendously brighter star situated off the above picture to the upper right.  The jet extends nearly a light-year and would not be visible without external illumination.  As gas and dust evaporate from the pillars, the hidden stellar source of this jet will likely be uncovered, possibly over the next 20,000 years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9906/trifid_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Trifid Pillars & Jets","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9906/trifidjet_hst.jpg"},{"date":"1999-06-09","explanation":"How far away is this galaxy?  Cosmologists the world over have been working hard to find out.  Spiral galaxy NGC 4414 contains many Cepheid variable stars that oscillate in a way that allows astronomers to estimate their distance.  From analyzing distances to galaxies like this, some astronomers have recently announced that they have again refined their estimate of the expansion rate of the universe.  The running debate over this rate is not yet over, however, as another group of astronomers has recently announced a distance that corresponds to a smaller universe expansion rate from a completely new method.  NGC 4414 shows many classic spiral galaxy features, including thick dust lanes, a central region rich in old red stars, and winding spiral arms glowing with young blue stars.  Even classic spirals contain new surprises, though, as an unusual blue variable object has recently been found in NGC 4414.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9906/ngc4414_heritage_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 4414: A Telling Spiral","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9906/ngc4414_heritage.jpg"},{"date":"1999-06-10","explanation":"The stark surface of Earth's moon is pocked with large craters, records of a history of fierce bombardment by the solar system's formative debris. It may be difficult to imagine, but nearby planet Earth itself has endured a similar cosmic pounding, though oceans, weathering, and geological activity have removed or hidden many of the telltale scars. For example, this false color image produced from seismic data shows a recently discovered ringed structure about 24 miles wide on the floor of the Barents Sea. It is most probably the result of the impact, roughly 150 million years ago, of a mile or so wide asteroid-like body. Estimates indicate that the energy released in the impact could have been as high as a million megatons of TNT, resulting in immense earthquakes and tidal waves. Drawing on Norse mythology, the crater has been aptly named Mj\u00f8lnir - Thor's hammer.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9906/hammer_tsikalas_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Mj\u00f8lnir: Impact Crater","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9906/hammer_tsikalas.jpg"},{"date":"1999-06-11","explanation":"This enhanced Hubble Space Telescope image shows in remarkable detail the inner portion of the disk of dust and gas surrounding the star AB Aurigae. Knots of material, visible here for the first time, may well represent an early stage of a process which could result in the formation of planets over the next few million years. AB Aurigae is a young star (2-4 million years old), about 469 light-years distant. Its swirling circumstellar disk is large, about 30 times the size of our solar system. Astronomers believe planet-making is just beginning in AB Aurigae's disk because known disks surrounding younger stars (less than 1 million years old) do not show such clumpy structure, while disks of slightly older stars (aged 8-10 million years) have gaps and features suggesting that planets have already been formed. Why the window pane appearance? Wide black stripes in the picture are caused by occulting bars used to block out the overwhelming starlight and the diagonal streaks are due to diffraction spikes.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9906/abaurigae_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"AB Aurigae: How To Make Planets","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9906/abaurigae_hst.jpg"},{"date":"1999-06-12","explanation":"Venus, the second closest planet to the Sun, is a popular way-point for spacecraft headed for the gas giant planets in the outer reaches of the solar system. Why visit Venus first? Using a \" gravity assist \" maneuver, spacecraft can swing by planets and gain energy during their brief encounter saving fuel for use at the end of their long interplanetary voyage. This colorized image of Venus was recorded by the Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft shortly after its gravity assist flyby of Venus in February of 1990. Galileo's glimpse of the veiled planet shows structure in swirling sulfuric acid clouds. The bright area is sunlight glinting off the upper cloud deck. The Saturn-bound Cassini spacecraft will complete its own second flyby of Venus on June 24th.
