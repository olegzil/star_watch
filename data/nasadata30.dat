International efforts to reduce the use of these damaging chemicals appear to be having a positive effect on their atmospheric abundance.

While the galaxy cluster lies about 5 billion light-years distant, spectroscopic studies show that the arc itself is actually a distorted image of an even more distant but enormous star-forming region.

The nearby nebulosity, shown above, is home to streams of hot gas, pools of cool gas, knots of dark globules, and pillars of dense dusty interstellar matter likely forming young stars.  The above image explores about three light-years, a region size intermediate to the Eta Carina cocoon, which spans only about one-half of a light year, and the Great Nebula in Carina, which spans over 300 light years.  In April of 1843 Eta Car briefly became second only to Sirius as the brightest star in planet Earth's night sky, even though at a distance of about 7,500 light-years, it is about 800 times farther away.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0311/carina2_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Turbulent Neighborhood of Eta Carina","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0311/carina2_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2003-11-27","explanation":"The long shadow of the Moon fell across the continent of Antarctica on November 23rd, during the second solar eclipse of 2003. In this view from orbit, based on data from the MODIS instrument on board the Earth observing Aqua satellite, the Moon's shadow stretches for almost 500 kilometers. Recorded between 23:15 and 23:20 Universal Time, the shadow was cast by a lunar disk silhouetted by the Sun hanging only about 15 degrees above the antarctic horizon. Observers within the central dark portion of the oval-shaped shadow could view the totally eclipsed sun.

An estimated 12 billion (12,000,000,000) light-years away, this appears to be the most distant energetic jet in the known Universe. Astrophysical jets of many sizes seem to be produced in a range of environments where significant accretion, or infalling matter is thought to arrange itself in a disk, from contracting star-forming clouds to supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. Here, as depicted in the illustration, the accretion disk is thought to surround a supermassive black hole, accelerating particles to near the speed of light in two jets at right angles to the disk itself. In the case of this quasar, the jet tilted towards us is visible in x-rays as the particles collide with low energy photons from the cosmic background radiation. The collisions boost the photons to higher x-ray energies and scatter some of them in our direction.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0311/gb1508_xray_illustration.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Most Distant X-Ray Jet","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0311/gb1508_xray_illustration90.jpg"},{"date":"2003-11-29","explanation":"Hurtling through space a mere 3,000 miles above the Martian surface, the diminutive moon Phobos (below and left of center) was imaged against the backdrop of a large shield volcano by the Viking 2 Orbiter in 1977.

Actually, pictured above are several clouds all stacked up into one striking lenticular cloud.  Normally, air moves much more horizontally than it does vertically.  Sometimes, however, such as when wind comes off of a mountain or a hill, relatively strong vertical oscillations take place as the air stabilizes.  The dry air at the top of an oscillation may be quite stratified in moisture content, and hence forms  clouds at each layer where the air saturates with moisture. The result can be a lenticular cloud with a strongly layered appearance.

The volcano is Mauna Kea, Hawai'i, USA, a frequent spot for spectacular photographs since it is arguably the premier observing location on planet Earth. The Sun has just set in the opposite direction, behind the camera. Additionally, the Moon has just passed full phase -- were it precisely at full phase it would rise, possibly eclipsed, at the very peak of the shadow. Refraction of moonlight through the Earth's atmosphere makes the Moon appear slightly oval.  Cinder cones from old volcanic eruptions are visible in the foreground. Cloud tops below Mauna Kea's summit have unusually flat tops, indicating a decrease in air moisture that frequently keeps the air unusually dry, another attribute of this stellar observing site.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0312/moonrisemk_connelley_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Moonrise Through Mauna Kea's Shadow","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0312/moonrisemk_connelley.jpg"},{"copyright":"Dan DurdaSwRI","date":"2003-12-04","explanation":"Headed for the first close-up exploration of the Pluto-Charon system and the icy denizens of the Kuiper belt, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft is pictured here in an artist's vision of the robot probe outward bound. The dramatic scene depicts the 465 kilogram spacecraft about one year after a planned 2006 launch, following a flyby of gas giant Jupiter. While the Jupiter flyby will be used as a gravity assist maneuver to save fuel and cut travel time to the outer reaches of the Solar System, it will also provide an opportunity to test instruments and study the giant planet, its moons, and magnetic fields. The Sun is seen from eight hundred million kilometers away, with inner planets Earth, Venus, and Mercury aligned on the left. A dim crescent of outermost Galilean moon Callisto, orbiting Jupiter just inside of the spacecraft's trajectory, appears to the upper right of the fading Sun.

Followed closely by ground-based instruments and the Hubble Space Telescope over the following months, it was soon realized that the quickly evolving dusty nebula surrounding V838 Mon was in fact made visible by \"light echoes\" from the outburst. Remarkably, as light from the outburst plays across layers of pre-existing circumstellar material, it gives the surrounding nebulosity the illusion of expanding \"faster than light\". Though the nebula's visible appearance changes dramatically over a period of months, it is actually at least 6 light years in diameter. A good astrophysical explanation for V838 Mon's outbursting behavior is still unknown but astronomers continue to follow the mystery star. This gorgeous image, based on data recorded on October 21 with the US Naval Observatory's 1.55 meter telescope, adopts the color scheme used in previous Hubble images for easy comparison.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0312/v838lar3_kelly_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Startling Star V838 Mon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0312/v838lar3_kelly_c1.jpg"},{"copyright":"Tim Feresten","date":"2003-12-06","explanation":"Walk through these doors and up the stairs to begin your journey along a line from Jaipur, India toward the North Celestial Pole.
