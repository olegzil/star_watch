Many young stars from this cloud are visible in the above image from the Hubble Space Telescope, along with what is left of the initial gas cloud.  Some stars were so massive they have already evolved and exploded in a supernova.

About every two years, however, the Earth passes Mars as they orbit around the Sun.  During the most recent such pass in August, Mars loomed particularly large and bright.

Triggered by solar activity, normal auroras are caused by collisions between fast-moving electrons and the oxygen and nitrogen in Earth's upper atmosphere. The electrons come from the magnetosphere, the region of space controlled by Earth's magnetic field.  As the excited oxygen and nitrogen molecules return to their low energy state, they emit light, seen as the auroral glow. Sometimes, however, auroras can be caused by collisions with heavier protons, causing a more energetic display with strong ultraviolet emission. In addition, protons can temporarily capture an electron and emit light for themselves. Such a proton aurora is seen above, recorded by the IMAGE satellite. A special feature is the bright spot near picture center, embedded in a ring of auroral emission around the north magnetic pole of planet Earth.  Most solar wind protons never reach the Earth to cause auroras because they are completely deflected away at a great distance by the Earth's magnetic field.  The bright spot in the auroral ring indicates a particularly deep crack in the Earth's magnetic field where protons were able to flow along a temporarily connected region between the Sun and the Earth, relatively undeflected, until they impacted the Earth's ionosphere.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0312/protonaurora_image.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Proton Aurora","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0312/protonaurora_image_big.jpg"},{"date":"2003-12-18","explanation":"Hurtling toward its destination, the high resolution camera on board ESA's Mars Express spacecraft recorded this tantalizing view of the Red Planet earlier this month on December 3rd.

This stunning celestial scene would also have been a rewarding one for the influential 18th century comet hunter Charles Messier. While Messier scanned French skies for comets, he carefully cataloged positions of things which were fuzzy and comet-like in appearance but did not move against the background stars and so were definitely not comets. The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as M31, is the 31st object in his famous not-a-comet catalog.

Actually, stars usually create their most artistic displays as they die.  In the case of low-mass stars like our Sun and  M2-9 pictured above, the stars transform themselves from normal stars to white dwarfs by casting off their outer gaseous envelopes.  The expended gas frequently forms an impressive display called a planetary nebula that fades gradually over thousand of years.  M2-9, a butterfly planetary nebula 2100 light-years away shown in representative colors, has wings that tell a strange but incomplete tale.  In the center, two stars orbit inside a gaseous disk 10 times the orbit of Pluto.  The expelled envelope of the dying star breaks out from the disk creating the bipolar appearance.

The cluster elemental abundances are consistent with the idea that most heavy elements were synthesized early on by massive stars, but current theories suggest that such a massive cluster should be rare in the early Universe.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0402/rdcs1252_xray_opt_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Galaxy Cluster in the Early Universe","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0402/rdcs1252_xray_opt_c1.jpg"},{"date":"2004-02-27","explanation":"Only a few short years ago, when the APOD editors were in graduate school, the pervasive, cosmic Dark Energy was not even seriously discussed. Of course, it now appears that this strange energy dominates the cosmos (as well as lectures on cosmology) and provides a repulsive force accelerating the large scale expansion of the Universe. In fact, recent brightness measurements of distant and therefore ancient, stellar explosions or supernovae indicate that the universal expansion began to speed up in earnest four to six billion years ago, when the Dark Energy's repulsive force began to overcome the attractive force of gravity over cosmic distances. The Hubble Space telescope images above show a sample of the distant supernova explosions, billions of light-years away, in before (top) and after (bottom) pictures of their faint host galaxies. Hubble measured supernovae also hint that the Dark Energy's repulsive force is constant over cosmic time and so could be consistent with Einstein's original theory of gravitation. If the force actually changes with time, the Universe could still end in a Big Crunch or a Big Rip ... but not for at least an estimated 30 billion years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0402/hiZsn_hubble_label.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Rumors of a Strange Universe","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0402/hiZsn_hubble_c1.jpg"},{"date":"2004-02-28","explanation":"Not so long ago and not so far, far away, a galaxy was born. Seen in this Hubble Space Telescope image, the island universe of stars, gas, and dust cataloged as POX 186 is a mere 68 million light-years distant toward an uncrowded region in the constellation Virgo. POX 186 is truly dwarfed by galaxies like our own Milky Way. The diminutive galaxy is about 900 light-years across with around 10 million stars, compared to the Milky Way's 100,000 light-year span and more than 200 billion stars. Cosmically speaking, POX 186 is also very young as the Hubble snapshot reveals a disturbed galaxy that is likely the result of a 100 million year old collision between two even smaller star systems. In fact, POX 186 observations suggest that such isolated, small galaxies may be the last to form, since the most massive galaxies in the universe seem to have formed billions of years ago.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0402/pox186_hst_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"POX 186: Not So Long Ago","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0402/pox186_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2004-02-29","explanation":"Today, February 29th, is a leap day - a relatively rare occurrence. In 46 BC, Julius Caesar, pictured above in a self-decreed minted coin, created a calendar system that added one leap day every four years. Acting on advice by Alexandrian astronomer Sosigenes, Caesar did this to make up for the fact that the Earth's year is slightly more than 365 days. In modern terms, the time it takes for the Earth to circle the Sun is slightly more than the time it takes for the Earth to rotate 365 times (with respect to the Sun -- actually we now know this takes about 365.24219 rotations). So, if calendar years contained 365 days they would drift from the actual year by about 1 day every 4 years. Eventually July (named posthumously for Julius Caesar himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter! By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years, the calendar year would drift much less. This Julian Calendar system was used until the year 1582 when Pope Gregory XIIIprovided further fine-tuning when he added that leap days should not occur in years ending in \"OO\", unless divisible by 400. This Gregorian Calendar system is the one in common use today.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0002/jcaesar_coin.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Julius Caesar and Leap Days","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0002/jcaesar_coin.jpg"},{"date":"2004-03-01","explanation":"Are they gone? They were not originally predicted to even be there.  The mystery revolves around strange shadow-like spokes that appeared on Saturn's large B-ring, the large middle ring in the complex system of particles that orbits Saturn.  The spokes were discovered 23 years ago by the passing Voyager spacecraft and attributed to very fine dust of unknown origin.  The missing spokes were noted in the above image, taken last month, from the robot Cassini spacecraft now approaching Saturn.  Launched in 1997, the distance remaining between Cassini and Saturn is now less than half that between the Earth and the Sun.  Cassini is expected to enter orbit around the ringed Jovian giant planet in July and drop a probe onto Titan, Saturn's largest moon.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0403/saturn0402_cassini_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Cassini Closes in on Saturn","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0403/saturn0402_cassini.jpg"},{"copyright":"T.

Pictured above is the west end of the Veil Nebula known technically as NGC 6960 but less formally as the Witch's Broom Nebula.  The rampaging gas gains its colors by impacting and exciting existing nearby gas.  The supernova remnant lies about 1400 light-years away towards the constellation of Cygnus.

To help answer this question, NASA launched two rover missions to the red planet and landed them in regions that satellite images indicated might have been covered with water.  Yesterday, mounting evidence was released indicating that the Mars Opportunity rover had indeed uncovered indications that its landing site, Meridiani Planum, was once quite wet.  Evidence that liquid water once flowed includes the physical appearance of many rocks, rocks with niches where crystals appear to have grown, and rocks with sulfates.  Pictured above, Opportunity looks back on its now empty lander.  Visible is some of the light rock outcropping that yielded water indications, as well as the rim of the small crater where Opportunity landed.

Still, ever since a sudden outburst was detected in January 2002, this enigmatic star has taken the center of an astronomical stage while researchers try to understand where it fits into the picture of stellar evolution. As light from the stellar flash echoes across pre-existing dust shells around V838 Mon, its appearance changes dramatically. Revealed in a sharp snapshot recorded in February by the Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys, this portion of the dust shell is about six light-years in diameter. But because light reflected from the dust follows only a slightly indirect path compared to the direct line-of-sight to the star, the light echoes visible now are only lagging about two years behind the outburst itself. Astronomers expect the expanding echoes to continue to light up the dusty environs of V838 Mon for at least the rest of the current decade.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0403/v838feb04_hst_bck.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"V838 Mon: Echoes from the Edge","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0403/v838feb04_hst_c1.jpg"},{"date":"2004-03-06","explanation":"Scattered debris from a cosmic supernova explosion lights up the sky in this gorgeous composited image based on data from the Hubble Space Telescope.

That date was the beginning of an exciting journey in astrophysics which led researchers to the understanding of an exotic new class of stars. The source of the March 5th Event is now attributed to a magnetar - a highly magnetized, spinning neutron star also born in the ancient stellar explosion which created supernova remnant N49.
