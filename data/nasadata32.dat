Sedna's highly elliptical orbit will further displace it by 10 times, making it a candidate for the long-hypothesized Oort cloud of icy objects thought to extend to the Solar System's edge.

If you could see gamma rays, the familiar skyscape of steady stars would be replaced by some of the most bizarre objects known to modern astrophysics -- and some which are unknown. When the EGRET instrument on the orbiting Compton Gamma-ray Observatory surveyed the sky in the 1990s, it cataloged 271 celestial sources of high-energy gamma-rays. Researchers identified some with exotic black holes, neutron stars, and distant flaring galaxies. But 170 of the cataloged sources, shown in the above all-sky map, remain unidentified. Many sources in this gamma-ray mystery map likely belong to already known classes of gamma-ray emitters and are simply obscured or too faint to be otherwise positively identified. However, astronomers have called attention to the ribbon of sources winding through the plane of the galaxy, projected here along the middle of the map, which may represent a large unknown class of galactic gamma-ray emitters. In any event, the unidentified sources could remain a mystery until the planned launch of the more sensitive Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope in 2007.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0404/un_egret_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Mystery In Gamma Rays","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0404/un_egret.jpg"},{"copyright":"Thomas NylenAndrew FountainPSUNASANSFRussell Croman","date":"2004-04-04","explanation":"A lake hidden beneath 19 meters of ice and gravel has been found near the bottom of the world that might contain an ecosystem completely separate from our own.

Therefore, different colors will come to the observer from slightly different directions.

As the picture looks toward the southeast, the stone just below the Moon is one of the inner bluestones rather than the famous Heel Stone, which marks the northeast direction of the summer solstice sunrise.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0405/LunarEclipseStonehenge_perkins_1.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Moon Between the Stones","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0405/LunarEclipseStonehenge_perkins_sm.jpg"},{"date":"2004-05-26","explanation":"From martian orbit, the Mars Express cameras looked down on the largest volcano in the solar system.

Fittingly named for the lofty abode of the gods of Greek mythology, Olympus Mons rises 21 kilometers above the surrounding plain or to about 3 times the height of Mt. Everest. The area pictured is 102 kilometers across and the caldera pits are up to 3 kilometers deep. For comparison, hawaiian volcanic calderas range up to 18 kilometers in diameter.

At the far left lies comet C/2002 T7 (LINEAR) and at the far right, comet C/2001 Q4 (NEAT). Recorded on the night of May 20th, the area around each of the comets has been separately enhanced here, making it easier to discern their extended tails streaming away from the Sun. While comet T7 (LINEAR) is the brighter of the two comets, both are now fading. Still, they may be visible for northern and southern observers with Q4 (NEAT) easiest to spot in the north. Of course, with bright Venus near the center on the horizon and the lights of nearby Tamworth city glowing at the bottom right, the two comets are not alone in this heavenly view.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0405/2comets_garradd_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Two Comets in Southern Skies","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0405/2comets_garradd_c2.jpg"},{"copyright":"Neil deGrasseTysonAMNH","date":"2004-05-28","explanation":"Today, if it is clear, Manhattan will flood dramatically with sunlight just as the Sun sets precisely on the centerline of every street.  Usually, the tall buildings that line the gridded streets of New York City's tallest borough will hide the setting Sun.  This effect makes Manhattan a type of modern Stonehenge, although only aligned to about 30 degrees east of north.  Were Manhattan's road grid perfectly aligned to east and west, today's effect would occur on the Vernal and Autumnal Equinox, March 21 and September 21, the only two days that the Sun rises and sets due east and west.  If today's sunset is hidden by clouds do not despair -- the same thing happens every May 28 and July 12.

A well-known example, the Cone Nebula within the bright galactic star-forming region NGC 2264, was captured in this close-up view from the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys. While the Cone Nebula, about 2,500 light-years away in Monoceros, is around 7 light-years long, the region pictured here surrounding the cone's blunted head is a mere 2.5 light-years across. In our neck of the galaxy that distance is just over half way from the Sun to its nearest stellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri. The massive star NGC 2264 IRS, seen by Hubble's infrared camera in 1997, is the likely source of the wind sculpting the Cone Nebula and lies off the top of the image.

The above scientifically color-coded image highlights the complexity and origin of the plume by combining a wide field image from the WIYN Telescope in Arizona with a smaller high-resolution image from the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.  M82's aspect in optical pictures has led to its popular moniker, the Cigar Galaxy.

The blue regions shine primarily by reflected light.  Blue light from the star Rho Ophiuchi and nearby stars reflects more efficiently off this portion of the nebula than red light.  The Earth's daytime sky appears blue for the same reason.  The red and yellow regions shine primarily because of emission from the nebula's atomic and molecular gas.  Light from nearby blue stars - more energetic than the bright star Antares - knocks electrons away from the gas, which then shines when the electrons recombine with the gas.  The dark regions are caused by dust grains - born in young stellar atmospheres - which effectively block light emitted behind them.  The Rho Ophiuchi star clouds, well in front of the globular cluster M4 visible above on far lower left, are even more colorful than humans can see - the clouds emits light in every wavelength band from the radio to the gamma-ray.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0405/rhooph_noao_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Colorful Clouds of Rho Ophiuchi","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0405/rhooph_noao.jpg"},{"date":"2004-06-03","explanation":"Stars and planets appear to be under construction in dusty nebula RCW 49.

The infrared data indicate the likely presence of protoplanetary discs around some of the infant suns, among the faintest and farthest potential planet-forming discs ever observed. Such exciting results give further support to the idea that planet-forming discs are a natural part of a star's evolution.

Within the dust-scattered sunlight are more familiar members of the solar system, including planet Earth. But at a distance of about 13 billion kilometers (8 billion miles) Earth would only be visible in binoculars or a small telescope. In Sedna's dark, daytime skies, the noonday Sun is also joined by the faint stars and obscuring dust clouds of the Milky Way, suspended on the left above stark, ruddy terrain. For Sedna-based sky gazers, all planets have interior orbits and would remain close to the Sun in Sedna's skies. Of course, for earthbound astronomers, interior planets Venus and Mercury also remain near the Sun, with Venus scheduled for a rare crossing of the solar disc on June 8.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0406/sednaIll_schaller_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Sedna at Noon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0406/sednaIll_schaller_c1.jpg"},{"date":"2004-06-05","explanation":"In December of 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt spent about 75 hours exploring the Moon's Taurus-Littrow valley while colleague Ronald Evans orbited overhead.
