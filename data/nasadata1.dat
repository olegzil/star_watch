Auroral color is determined by which atmospheric ions are struck and recombine to form neutral atoms. Hourly updates of auroral sightings are posted to the WWW.

By looking at external galaxies, astronomers can guess that these events, known as a supernovae, should occur about once every 30 years in a typical spiral galaxy like our MilkyWay. However, the obscuring gas and dust in the disk of our galaxy probably prevents us from seeing many galactic supernovae -- making observations of these events in our own galaxy relatively rare. In fact, in 1572, the revered Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe, witnessed one of the last to be seen. The remnant of this explosion is still visible today as the shockwave it generated continues to expand into the gas and dust between the stars. Above is an image of the X-rays emitted by this shockwave made by a telescope onboard the ROSAT spacecraft.

While hunting for comets in the skies above France he made a now famous list of the positions of about 100 fuzzy, diffuse looking objects which appeared at fixed positions in the sky. Although these objects looked like comets, Messier knew that since they did not move with respect to the background stars they could not be the comets he was searching for. These objects are now well known to modern astronomers to be among the brightest and most striking nebulae, star clusters, and galaxies. Objects on Messier's list are still referred to by their \"Messier number\".

The dust emits little visible light of its own - in the absence of a nearby star the dust would appear dark, blocking light from background stars. The red color of the nebula farthest from the bright stars is caused by glowing hydrogen gas.

Geyser-like eruptions from volcanoes on this Jovian moon were seen by both Voyager spacecraft in 1979 and were also spotted this year in late June by Galileo's camera from a distance of about 600,000 miles.  The blue plume seen at the moon's edge (magnified in the inset) arises from Ra Patera, a large shield volcano, and extends about 60 miles above the surface. The blue color is attributed to condensing and freezing sulfur dioxide gas. Galileo images have also revealed that the plume glows in the dark - perhaps due to fluorescence of excited sulfur and oxygen ions. Io's surface is cold, its temperature averages about -230 degrees Fahrenheit, so why is it so active? The most likely cause is the gravitational tug of war over Io between Jupiter and the other Galilean moons which perturbs Io's orbit. The orbital changes would result in tidal force variations heating Io's interior and and generating the sulfurous volcanic activity.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/iovol2_gal_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Galileo Views Io Eruption","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/iovol2_gal.gif"},{"date":"1996-08-16","explanation":"The nebula cataloged as NGC 604 is a giant star forming region, 1500 light years across, in the nearby spiral galaxy, M33.

How do you find a meteorite from Mars here on Earth? On a typical day, several large rocks fall to Earth from space, usually winding up in the oceans.

(Danger from falling meteorites is rare: the average person would have to repair meteorite damage to their home about every 100 million years.) Most meteorites falling on land are never located or identified - appearing similar to other rocks to the untrained eye. In certain places in Antarctica, however, meteorites stand out from the white frozen ice and snow beneath them, as if they were just left yesterday. When the above meteorite was found in Antarctica, it was considered unusual because of its grey color. So far, about 12 Martian meteorites of similar mineral compostion have been found. One of these contains minute pockets of gases identical in isotopic composition to the Martian atmosphere as determined from the Viking measurements - implying the rocks indeed originated on Mars.

But when photographed in the \r ultraviolet (UV), as \r shown above in false color, the galaxy sports an ultraviolet halo - shown as violet in the photograph. The blue spiral structure closer to the picture's center indicates normal ultraviolet emission from bright young stars that have recently formed there. \r Astronomers now hypothesize that the outer glow arises from UV light emitted from the galaxy's active center and reflected to us from clouds of \r gas and \r dust. These same gas and dust clouds obscure the active center of this \r Seyfert galaxy - where an ultramassive \r black hole is thought to live.\r \r","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/m77_uit_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"M77: Spiral with a Strange Glow","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/m77_uit.gif"},{"date":"1996-09-11","explanation":"\r What is happening in the center of nearby spiral galaxy M77? To find out, astronomers used the \r Hubble Space Telescope to peer deep into the \r dusty chaos of this \r active galactic nucleus in 1994. \r They found a network of filamentary gas and opaque dust that provides only clues as to what central monster had left this mess. Due to the presence of hot ionized gas clouds near the core, changes in brightness that can take less than a week, and the \r ultraviolet halo surrounding the whole galaxy, the leading hypothesis is that a supermassive \r black hole lies at the center of this \r Seyfert Type 2 galaxy.

But \r Mercury is unique in many ways. \r Mercury is the closest planet to the \r Sun, orbiting at about 1/3 the radius of the \r Earth's orbit. As \r Mercury slowly rotates, its surface temperature varies from an unbearably cold -180 degrees \r Celsius to an unbearably hot 400 degrees \r Celsius. The place nearest the \r Sun in \r Mercury's orbit changes slightly each orbit - a fact used by \r Albert Einstein to help verify the correctness of his then newly discovered theory of gravity: \r General Relativity.  \r The above picture was taken by the only spacecraft ever to pass \r Mercury: \r Mariner 10 in 1974.\r \r","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/merc2_m10_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Mercury: A Cratered Inferno","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/merc2_m10.gif"},{"date":"1996-09-13","explanation":"\r The planet Mercury resembles a moon. \r Mercury's\r old surface is heavily \r cratered like many moons. \r Mercury is larger than most moons but smaller than \r Jupiter's moon \r Ganymede and \r Saturn's moon \r Titan.
