Since their discovery in the early 1970s, nobody has been able to explain the cause of mysterious flashes of gamma rays that come from seemingly random directions on the sky. Worse yet, it is even unclear whether these high energy explosions originate in our own Galaxy or in distant galaxies across the Universe. Until late last month, these bursters were known only by their gamma-ray flashes - no counterpart had been seen at any other wavelength. But on February 28, an Italian/Dutch satellite known as BeppoSAX detected what may well be X-rays from a burster, eight hours after the gamma-ray flash. The discovery image is shown above. Still hours later, using the position provided by this X-ray image, ground-based telescopes recovered an even better located variable optical source which also seems to be related to the burster. Dramatically, this optical transient has faded now. In its place lies a steady source that appears to be a dim, distant galaxy. Did this Gamma-Ray Burst originate in the distant galaxy?

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are powerful explosions occurring in seemingly random positions on the sky.  They are so featureless and so poorly resolved, however, that their distances could not be determined.  Last Thursday, May 8th, the orbiting Beppo-Sax Satellite detected and precisely located a GRB (GRB970508), quickly relaying its position to astronomers. Within hours, many of the world's most powerful telescopes were re-pointed in the direction of the new GRB.  There they found a faint but variable optical source: a potential counterpart to the gamma-ray burst that was getting brighter.  Most importantly, continued scrutiny showed that this optical transient had absorption lines with a redshift of about 0.8 - the distance scale of galaxies and quasars. If this source and GRB970508 are related, the GRB itself must be many billions of light-years away and the 30-year controversy on the distance scale to GRBs will draw dramatically to a close. GRBs could move from the realm of astronomical mystery to useful beacons of the early universe.

In fact, material spiraling into a black hole would find its speed increasing at a drastic rate. These extreme velocity increases provide a \"signature\" of the black hole's presence. STIS relies on the Doppler effect to measure gas velocity rapidly increasing to nearly 240 miles per second within 26 light years of the center of M84, a galaxy in the Virgo Cluster about 50 million light years away.

Dim and difficult to detect, an abundance of objects like Gl623b has been proposed as a possible solution to the mystery of \"Dark Matter\" in the Universe.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9706/gl623_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Small Star\nCredit:","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9706/gl623_hst.jpg"},{"date":"1997-06-06","explanation":"ven great observatories need a boost from time to time -- including the orbiting Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. Sparkling reflections and the bright limb of the Earth are visible in this 1991 window view of Compton's release into orbit by the crew of the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Named after the American Nobel-prize-winning physicist, Arthur Holly Compton, the Compton Observatory has spent the last 6 years making spectacular discoveries while exploring the Universe at extreme gamma-ray energies. From its post over 240 miles above the Earth's surface, the 17 ton satellite still experiences enough atmospheric drag to cause its orbit to deteriorate over time.  But NASA controllers have just completed a complex two month long series of firings of Compton's on-board thrusters which has raised its orbit to an altitude of over 300 miles. This reboost (Compton's second in 6 years) should allow it to continue its voyage of exploration of the distant high-energy Universe until about 2007.

The explorations conducted during the Apollo lunar missions discovered much about our Moon, including that the Moon is made of ancient rock, that the Moon's composition is similar to Earth's, that life is not evident there, that the Moon underwent a great hot melting in its distant past, that the Moon has suffered from numerous impacts as shown by its craters, and that the Moon's surface is covered by a layer of rock fragments and dust.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/lunrov_a15_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Apollo 15: Driving on the Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/lunrov_a15.gif"},{"date":"1997-06-08","explanation":"This giant spiral galaxy, Messier 101 (M101), was photographed by the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT). UIT flew into orbit as part of the Astro 2 mission on-board the Space Shuttle Endeavour in March 1995. The image has been processed so that the colors (purple to white) represent an increasing intensity of ultraviolet light. Pictures of galaxies like this one show mainly clouds of gas containing newly formed stars many times more massive than the sun, which glow strongly in ultraviolet light. In contrast, visible light pictures of galaxies tend to be dominated by the yellow and red light of older stars. Ultraviolet light, invisible to the human eye, is blocked by ozone in the atmosphere so ultraviolet pictures of celestial objects must be taken from space.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9706/m101_uit_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"M101: An Ultraviolet View\nCredit:","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9706/m101_uit.jpg"},{"date":"1997-06-09","explanation":"Do other planets have aurora?  Terrestrial and spacecraft observations have found evidence for aurora on Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. In the above false-color photograph, a good portion of an auroral ring was captured recently in optical light by the Galileo spacecraft in orbit around Jupiter.  Auroral rings encircle a planet's magnetic pole, and result from charged particles spiraling down magnetic field lines.

It resides in the midst of the obscuring gas and dust of a nearby star forming region popularly known as the Cone Nebula. Imaged in penetrating infrared light by the Hubble Space Telescope's newly operational NICMOS instrument, this young and massive star was found to be surrounded by six \"baby\" sun-like stars - all within less than a tenth of a light-year of their \"big brother\". The diffraction spikes and rings surrounding big brother are image artifacts. Astronomers believe that the high speed winds generated by the massive star compressed nearby material causing the formation of the smaller stars in a text book example of triggered star formation. The newly created suns appear to lie along an otherwise invisible boundary where the high speed gas has collided with the wall of a denser molecular cloud. NGC2264 IRS also seems to be the source of the outflow which created the striking cone shape of the optical nebula.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9706/ngc2264_nic_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Young Suns","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9706/ngc2264_nic.jpg"},{"date":"1997-06-12","explanation":"Known for its spectacular images of Jupiter's moons, Io, Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa, the robot spacecraft Galileo has also aggressively explored the Jovian atmosphere. In December of 1995, Galileo's atmospheric probe descended into Jupiter's clouds and reported a surprising absence of water. It is now believed that the probe entered through one of Jupiter's dry spots, similar to the dark region in this image of the swirling Jovian cloud deck. The smallest features visible here are tens of miles in size. These dry regions appear to correspond to locations where winds converge creating downdrafts. The downdrafts generate local cloudless clearings through which Jupiter's deeper warmer layers can be glimpsed. Just as the dark areas are extremely dry, the surroundings are full of moisture. The contrast is analogous to the desert and tropics of Earth.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9706/jupdry_gal_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Jupiter's Dry Spots","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9706/jupdry_gal.jpg"},{"date":"1997-06-13","explanation":"Glowing gas clouds are streaming from the core of galaxy NGC4151 at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour. A powerful tool, the Hubble Space Telescope's new STIS instrument, makes it possible to map out the cloud velocities - producing this false color \"velocity map\" for the central regions of NGC4151. The horizontal line is light from the intensely bright region near the galaxy nucleus.  Emission at two wavelengths characteristic of Oxygen atoms in the gas clouds is visible along this line. Below the line the emission is displaced to the left, indicating motion toward us (blue shift); above the displacement is to the right indicating a receding motion (red shift). Where do the clouds come from? As evidence mounts, the widely accepted explanation for energetic nuclear activity in galaxies is based on material spiraling into a central black hole with over a million times the mass of our sun. The rotating disk of interstellar debris which develops is thought to blast out high velocity jets along the axis of the disk.

To answer this, cosmologists run sophisticated computer programs tracking the locations of millions of particles. The above animated frame is the result of such a calculation and shows how our universe might have looked when it was just a fracton of its current age.  The universe started out very smooth - matter and light are spread almost uniformly. As time progressed, gravity caused slight gatherings of mass to accrete so that ever greater conglomerations formed.  Galaxies and long filaments formed - which are shown by the bright patches and streaks in the above frame. An IMAX movie including hundreds of these frames was nominated for an academy award.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/earlyuni_imax_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Early Universe","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/earlyuni_imax.gif"}]
