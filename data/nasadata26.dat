The black hole has such strong gravity that light is noticeably bent towards it - causing some very unusual visual distortions. In the distorted frame, every star in the normal frame has at least two bright images - one on each side of the black hole.  In fact, near the black hole, you can see the whole sky - light from every direction is bent around and comes back to you.

Between the two is a gap that appears almost completely dark.  How Hoag's Object formed remains unknown, although similar objects have now been identified and collectively labeled as a form of ring galaxy.  Genesis hypotheses include a galaxy collision billions of years ago and perturbative gravitational interactions involving an unusually shaped core.  The above photo taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in July 2001 reveals unprecedented details of Hoag's Object and may yield a better understanding.   Hoag's Object spans about 100,000 light years and lies about 600 million light years away toward the constellation of Serpens.

The bright lunar hemisphere shines in x-rays because it scatters x-rays emitted by the sun. The background sky has an x-ray glow in part due to the myriad of distant, powerful active galaxies, unresolved in the ROSAT picture but recently detected in Chandra Observatory x-ray images.

Most telescopes are on the ground.  On the ground, you can deploy a heavier telescope and fix it more easily.  The trouble is that Earth-bound telescopes must look through the Earth's atmosphere. First, the Earth's atmosphere blocks out a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum, allowing a narrow band of visible light to reach the surface. Telescopes which explore the Universe using light beyond the visible spectrum, such as those onboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory need to be carried above the absorbing atmosphere. Second, the Earth's atmosphere blurs the light it lets through.  The blurring is caused by varying density and continual motion of air.  By orbiting above the Earth's atmosphere, the Hubble Space Telescope, pictured above, can get clearer images.

Briefly firing its rocket engine and lifting itself some 4 meters above the surface, the Surveyor moved about 2.5 meters to one side before setting down again. The hopping success of Surveyor 6 essentially marked the completion of the Surveyor series main mission - to determine if the lunar terrain was safe for the planned Apollo landings.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0211/pan_surveyor6_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Surveyor Hops","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0211/pan_surveyor6_full.jpg"},{"copyright":"AAO","date":"2002-12-01","explanation":"It is the most famous star cluster on the sky. The Pleiades can be seen without binoculars from even the depths of a light-polluted city.  Also known as the Seven Sisters and M45, the Pleiades is one of the brightest and closest open clusters.   The Pleiades contains over 3000 stars, is about 400 light years away, and only 13 light years across.  Quite evident in the above photograph are the blue reflection nebulae that surround the bright cluster stars.  Low mass, faint, brown dwarfs have recently been found in the Pleiades.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/pleiades_aao_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Pleiades Star Cluster","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/pleiades_aao.jpg"},{"copyright":"T.

M33 is also called the Triangulum Galaxy for the constellation in which it resides.  About four times smaller (in radius) than our Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), it is much larger than the many of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies.  M33's proximity to M31 causes it to be thought by some to be a satellite galaxy of this more massive galaxy.  M33's proximity to our Milky Way Galaxy causes it to appear more than twice the angular size of the Full Moon, and be visible with a good pair of binoculars. The above high-resolution image from the 0.90-m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory is a four-color composite.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/m33_noao_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Nearby Spiral M33","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/m33_noao.jpg"},{"copyright":"Fred Espenak","date":"2002-12-03","explanation":"On December 4th, for the second time in as many years, the Moon's shadow will track across southern Africa bringing a total solar eclipse to African skies. Reaching Africa just before 6:00 Universal Time, the narrow path of totality - corresponding to the path of the Moon's umbra or dark central shadow - will run eastward through Angola, Namibia (Caprivi Strip), Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa's Kruger National Park, and Mozambique. Moving out across the Indian Ocean it will ultimately cross onto the Australian continent at sunset (around 9:10 UT). Observers directly in this path could catch at most a minute or so of the eclipse at its total phase, but at least a partial eclipse will be visible over much of Africa, Australia, some parts of Indonesia, and eastern Antarctica. While watching last year's June 21 eclipse, astronomer Fred Espenak recorded a series of exposures used to construct this dramatic composite image. The sequence follows the 2001 geocentric celestial event from start to finish above a thorny acacia tree near Chisamba, Zambia.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/tse2001a_espenak.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Eclipse Over Acacia","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/tse2001a_espenak.jpg"},{"date":"2002-12-04","explanation":"Gliding toward today's total eclipse of the Sun, the crescent Moon has been rising early, just before dawn. And as a prelude to its close solar alignment, the Moon also completed a lovely celestial triangle, closing with bright planets Mars and Venus on the morning of December 1. While the total solar eclipse can only be seen from a narrow corridor, skygazers around the globe could appreciate this lunar-planetary conjunction. This view is from near Nashville Tennessee, USA, and finds brilliant Venus at the lowest corner of the triangle with a much fainter Mars immediately to the right of the Moon. The Moon's sunlit crescent is overexposed, but details of the lunar night side are revealed by earthshine. Above and to the right of the trio is Spica, brightest star in the constellation Virgo.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/moontrio_koehn_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Moon, Mars, Venus, and Spica","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/moontrio_koehn.jpg"},{"date":"2002-12-05","explanation":"NGC 2359 is a striking emission nebula with an impressive popular name - Thor's Helmet. Sure, its suggestive winged appearance might lead some to refer to it as the \"duck nebula\", but if you were a nebula which name would you choose? By any name NGC 2359 is a bubble-like nebula some 30 light-years across, blown by energetic winds from an extremely hot star seen near the center and classified as a Wolf-Rayet star. Wolf-Rayet stars are rare massive blue giants which develop stellar winds with speeds of millions of kilometers per hour. Interactions with a nearby large molecular cloud are thought to have contributed to this nebula's more complex shape and curved bow-shock structures. NGC 2359 is about 15,000 light-years distant toward the constellation Canis Major.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/ngc2359_smith_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 2359: Thor's Helmet","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/ngc2359_smith.jpg"},{"date":"2002-12-06","explanation":"Normally hiding from view in the glare of the Sun, the shy solar corona came out to play Wednesday as a total solar eclipse graced morning skies over southern Africa. This telescopic image of the Sun's corona or outer atmosphere shimmering around the silhouetted Moon was recorded near the centreline of the total eclipse path, 10 kilometers north of Beitbridge, Zimbabwe. At that location, near the Zimbabwe - South Africa border, the total phase pictured here lasted a leisurely one minute and 23 seconds. Zimbabwean photographer Murray Alexander reported that fortunately no clouds interfered but few people were present, while many watching from the South Africa side were clouded out. Still, if you missed this geocentric celestial event, just wait until next year. Two solar eclipses and two lunar eclipses are on planet Earth's schedule for 2003, along with a transit of Mercury.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/tse2002_alexander1.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Zimbabwe Solar Eclipse","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/tse2002_alexander1.jpg"},{"date":"2002-12-07","explanation":"Pictured above is the innermost of Jupiter's Galilean satellites, Io, superposed in front of the gas giant planet. To the left of Io is a dark spot that is Io's own shadow.  A solar eclipse would be seen from within the shadow spot on Jupiter. Viewed from planet Earth, similar shadows of Jupiter's large moons can often be seen crossing the giant planet's disk. But during the next several months, the Galilean moons can also be seen crossing in front of each other as, for a while, their orbits lie nearly edge-on when viewed by earthbound observers. This true-color contrast-enhanced image was taken two years ago by the robot spacecraft Cassini, as it passed Jupiter on its way to Saturn in 2004.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/jupiterIo_cassini_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Jupiter, Io and Shadow","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0212/jupiterIo_cassini.jpg"}]
