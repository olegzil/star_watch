A consequence of this is that one side always leads the other.  Rhea's leading surface is much more heavily cratered than its trailing surface.

Initially the shockwave was moving at millions of kilometers per hour, but the weight of all the gas it has swept up has slowed it considerably.  Pictured above, the shockwave moves from left to right, as can be discerned by the lack of gas on the left.

No known stars appear to be composed of truly primordial gas -- all of the stars around us have too many heavy elements.  Our own Sun is thought to be a third generation star, with many second-generation stars seen in globular clusters.   This year, however, significant progress is being made on solving this perennial astronomical mystery.   Analyses of recent WMAP satellite images of the cosmic microwave background indicate that this primordial light was ionized by a first generation of stars that came and went only 200 million years after the Big Bang.  Additionally computer codes are now more-accurately tracking the likely creation and evolution of first stars in the early universe.  Pictured above at a scale of one light-month, a computer-generated model resolves the scale of the first stars, indicating clean cocoons that condensed into stars always over 30 times the mass of our Sun.

Some of these structures are visible on one of the most comprehensive maps of the sky ever made in galaxies: the APM galaxy survey map completed in the early 1990s.  Over 2 million galaxies are depicted above in a region 100 degrees across centered toward our Milky Way Galaxy's south pole.

Such an extremely energetic collapse is also a leading explanation for the mysterious cosmic gamma-ray bursts.

Their dynamical evidence is summarized in this color image of a gorgeous region in Cygnus, showing Cyg X-1 and a cluster of massive stars (yellow circles) known as Cygnus OB3. Arrows compare the measured direction and speed of Cyg X-1 and the average direction and speed of the massive stars of Cyg OB3. The similar motions indicate that Cyg X-1's progenitor star was itself a cluster member and that its path was not altered at all when it became a black hole. In contrast, if Cyg X-1 were born in a violent supernova it would have likely received a fierce kick, changing its course.

Tonight and through much of this week, many communities around the world are running a public Mars Watch 2003 campaign, where local telescopes will zoom in on the red planet.  Pictured above is an image of Mars taken just last night from the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit around the Earth. This image is the most detailed view of Mars ever taken from Earth. Visible features include the south polar cap in white at the image bottom, circular Huygens crater just to the right of the image center, Hellas Impact Basin - the large light circular feature at the lower right, planet-wide light highlands dominated by many smaller craters and large sweeping dark areas dominated by relatively smooth lowlands.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0308/bigmars_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Big Mars from Hubble","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0308/bigmars_hst.jpg"},{"copyright":"Wally Pacholka","date":"2003-08-28","explanation":"Yesterday, at about 10 am Universal Time, Mars and Earth passed closer than in nearly 60,000 years.  Mars, noticeably red, remains the brightest object in the eastern sky just after sunset.  The best views of Mars, however, will continue to be from the robot spacecraft currently orbiting Mars: the Mars Global Surveyor and the Mars Odyssey.  The current pass sparked the launching of four new spacecraft toward Mars, some of which will deploy landers early next year and likely return even more spectacular views of our planetary neighbor.

Still, this mosaic of 53 images was recorded by the Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft as it passed near our own large natural satellite in 1992. The pictures were recorded through three spectral filters and combined in an exaggerated false-color scheme to explore the composition of the lunar surface as changes in mineral content produce subtle color differences in reflected light. Familiar to earthdwellers, the lunar near side is on the left, but the space-based view looks down on the Moon's north pole located in the upper half of the image near the shadow line. Blue to orange shades indicate volcanic lava flows. The dark blue Mare Tranquillitatis at the lower left is richer in titanium bearing minerals than the green and orange maria above it. Near the bottom of the image and to the right of Tranquillitatis is the dark oval-shaped Mare Crisium surrounded by shocking pink colors indicating material of the lunar highlands.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0308/PIA00131_colormoon_gal_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Mineral Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0308/PIA00131_colormoon_gal_c1.jpg"},{"date":"2003-08-30","explanation":"For billions of years, massive stars in our Milky Way Galaxy have lived spectacular lives.  Collapsing from vast cosmic clouds, their nuclear furnaces ignite and create heavy elements in their cores. After a few million years, the enriched material is blasted back into interstellar space where star formation begins anew. The expanding debris cloud known as Cassiopeia A is an example of this final phase of the stellar life cycle. Light from the explosion which created this supernova remnant was probably first seen in planet Earth's sky just over 300 years ago, although it took that light more than 10,000 years to reach us. In this gorgeous Hubble Space Telescope image of cooling filaments and knots in the Cas A remnant, light from specific elements has been color coded to help astronomers understand the recycling of our galaxy's star stuff. For instance, red regions are dominated by emission from sulfur atoms while blue shades correspond to oxygen.  The area shown is about 10 light-years across.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0308/casA_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Recycling Cassiopeia A","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0308/casA_hst.jpg"},{"copyright":"Roddy Mackenzie","date":"2003-08-31","explanation":"What would it be like to stand atop the tallest mountain on Earth?  To see a full panoramic vista from there, scroll right.  Visible are snow peaked mountains near and far, tremendous cliffs, distant plateaus, the tops of clouds, and a dark blue sky.  Mt. Everest stands 8.85 kilometers above sea level, roughly the maximum height reached by international airplane flights, but much less than the 300 kilometers achieved by a space shuttle.  Hundreds of people have tried and failed to climb the behemoth by foot, a feat first accomplished successfully in 1953.  About 1000 people have now made it to the summit.  Roddy Mackenzie, who climbed the mountain in 1989, captured the above image. Mt. Everest lies in the Himalayan mountains in the country of Nepal.

A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy, the Trifid alone illustrates three basic types of astronomical nebulae; red emission nebulae dominated by light from hydrogen atoms, blue reflection nebulae produced by dust reflecting starlight, and dark absorption nebulae where dense dust clouds appear in silhouette. The bright emission nebula on the right, separated into three parts by obscuring dust lanes, lends the nebula its popular name. Many details are apparent in this gorgeous high-resolution image of the Trifid. For example, light-year long pillars and jets sculpted by newborn stars - visible here in the upper right-hand corner of the emission nebula - appear in Hubble Space Telescope close-up images of the region.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0308/m20castano_block_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Beautiful Trifid","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0308/m20castano_block_c1.jpg"},{"copyright":"Mark StrongeEAAS","date":"2003-09-02","explanation":"Is that really another world?  Thousands of people the world over lined up last week to see Mars through a telescope as the red planet and Earth passed unusually close together in their orbits around the Sun. Reviews of Mars were mixed, with some people disappointed that Mars still appeared somewhat blurry.  Veteran sky gazers appeared somewhat surprised by the popularity of the phenomenon, as it seemed to many that Mars was not very much brighter than it frequently appears, and the event held little promise for real discovery.  Most observers, though, appeared quietly pleased to take advantage of a unique opportunity and see such an uncommon sight.  Many were awed by the simple enormity of being able to see the face of a completely different world with their own eyes.

Ancient humans might have noticed the supernova as a temporary star, but modern humans can see the expanding shell of gas even today.  Pictured above, part of the shell of IC 443 is seen to be composed of complex filaments, some of which are impacting an existing molecular cloud.  Here emission from shock-excited molecular hydrogen is allowing astronomers to study how fast moving supernova gas affects star formation in the cloud.  Additionally, astronomers theorize that the impact accelerates some particles to velocities near the speed of light.

The spectacular picture combines optical data (red) from the Hubble Space Telescope and x-ray images (blue) from the Chandra Observatory, also used in the popular Crab Pulsar movies. Like a cosmic dynamo the pulsar powers the x-ray and optical emission from the nebula, accelerating charged particles and producing the eerie, glowing x-ray jets. Ring-like structures are x-ray emitting regions where the high energy particles slam into the nebular material. The innermost ring is about a light-year across. With more mass than the Sun and the density of an atomic nucleus, the spinning pulsar is the collapsed core of a massive star that exploded, while the nebula is the expanding remnant of the star's outer layers.

SIRTF (sounds like \"sir tiff\") will explore the distant Universe in infrared light as the fourth and final satellite observatory in NASA's Great Observatories Program. The three other large astrophysics satellites were designed for higher energies in the electromagnetic spectrum, with the Hubble Space Telescope operating near visible wavelengths, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory instruments sensitive to gamma rays, and the Chandra Observatory detecting cosmic x-rays. SIRTF has been launched into an Earth-trailing solar orbit to reduce its exposure to infrared radiation from our fair planet. Cooled by an on board supply of liquid helium, SIRTF's infrared detectors will operate at near absolute zero temperatures.

Scrolling right will reveal the full picture, a color mosaic of Jupiter from the Cassini spacecraft. The mosaic is actually a single frame from a fourteen frame movie constructed from image data recorded by Cassini during its leisurely flyby of the solar system's largest planet in late 2000. The engaging movie approximates Jupiter's cloud motions over 24 jovian rotations. To make it, a series of observations covering Jupiter's complete circumference 60 degrees north and south of the equator were combined in an animated cylindrical projection map of the planet. As in the familiar rectangular-shaped wall maps of the Earth's surface, the relative sizes and shapes of features are correct near the equator but become progressively more distorted approaching the polar regions. In the Cassini movie, which also features guest appearances by moons Io and Europa, the smallest cloud structures visible at the equator are about 600 kilometers across.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0309/jupiterpeel_cassini_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Jupiter Unpeeled","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0309/jupiterpeel_cassini.jpg"}]
