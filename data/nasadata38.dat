On toward the Jovian poles though, the cloud structures become more mottled and convoluted until, as in this Cassini spacecraft mosaic of Jupiter, the planet's polar region begins to look something like a brain! This striking equator-to-pole change in cloud patterns is not presently understood but may be due in part to the effect of Jupiter's rapid rotation or to convection vortices generated at high latitudes by the massive planet's internal heat loss.

The symmetric cloud dubbed the Boomerang appears to have been created by a high-speed wind of gas and dust blowing from an aging central star at speeds of nearly 600,000 kilometers per hour.  What confines the wind remains a mystery though -- it may be a central disk of dense gas or a central magnetic field.   The rapid expansion itself, however, has cooled molecules in the nebular gas to about one degree above absolute zero - colder than even the cosmic background radiation - making it the coldest known region in the distant Universe.  Shining with light from the central star reflected by dust, the frigid Boomerang Nebula is believed to be a star or stellar system evolving toward the planetary nebula phase.  To help better understand the Boomerang's origin, astronomers are studying the above image taken in polarized light, color coded by an angular direction associated with the polarization.  Different progenitor scenarios create different amounts and patterns of polarized light.   The above image was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys earlier this year.

The most energetic type of explosions known in the cosmos has been an enigma since discovered over 30 years ago.  It now appears that there may not be one unique type of progenitor.  Long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been localized, over the past few years, to blue regions in the universe rich in star formation.  Massive young stars nearing the end of their short lives commonly explode in these regions.  Astronomers associate these long duration GRBs, that can last from seconds to minutes, with a type of stellar explosion common in young massive stars.  Over the past few months, short duration GRBs have finally been localized and found to occur in different types of regions -- not only blue regions rich in star formation.  Many astronomers therefore now theorize that short GRBs, which typically last less than one second, are the result of a different progenitor process than long GRBs.  A leading model is that a short GRB will occur when a neutron star either impacts another neutron star or a black hole.   Such collisions may occur well after star-forming regions have otherwise burned out. Pictured in the above illustration, two energized neutrons stars finally approach each other in their orbits, a death spiral that might end with a short GRB.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0510/nsmerger_heasarc_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Short Gamma-Ray Bursts Localized","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0510/nsmerger_heasarc.jpg"},{"copyright":"Thomas V.

The Moon's apparently squashed shape is due to atmospheric bending of light or refraction - an effect which is more severe closer to the horizon. Skimming low along the stark features of the frozen landscape, the Moon's lower edge appears noticeably more distorted than the upper limb. Along with about 70 others present at Davis Station, Dr. Jim Behrens had a chance to enjoy the view while studying the ongoing detachment of a large iceberg known as \"Loose Tooth\".","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0511/moonantarctica_behrens_f.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Moon Over Antarctica","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0511/moonantarctica_behrens_f27.jpg"},{"copyright":"Greg Piepol","date":"2005-11-26","explanation":"A stereo view of the closest star, this creatively composited image was constructed from an extensive archive of pictures taken between March 2004 and April 2005. When viewed with red/blue glasses, the Sun's disk and surface features, including sunspots, filaments, and prominences, stand out in an exaggerated stereo perspective. The images were recorded through a narrow band hydrogen-alpha filter, designed to transmit only light from hydrogen atoms in the solar atmosphere. After combining the solar hydrogen-alpha images, a 3D star field was added to the final anaglyphic stereo view.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0511/solar3d1_piepol_f.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Stereo Sun","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0511/solar3d_piepol_c.jpg"},{"date":"2005-11-27","explanation":"What caused this outburst of V838 Mon?  For reasons unknown, star V838 Mon's outer surface suddenly greatly expanded with the result that it became the brightest star in the entire Milky Way Galaxy in January 2002.  Then, just as suddenly, it faded.  A stellar flash like this has never been seen before -- supernovas and novas expel matter out into space.  Although the V838 Mon flash appears to expel material into space, what is seen in the above image from the Hubble Space Telescope is actually an outwardly moving light echo of the bright flash.  In a light echo, light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant rings in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star.  V838 Mon lies about 20,000 light years away toward the constellation of the unicorn (Monoceros), while the light echo above spans about six light years in diameter.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0511/v838feb04_hst_bck.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Light Echoes from V838 Mon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0511/v838feb04_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2005-11-28","explanation":"What is the geologic history of Mars?  To help find out, the robot Spirit rover explored the terrain on the way up to the top of Husband Hill and took pictures along the way.  Earth-bound team members later combined images from one camera with colors from another to create this semi-realistic vista from near the top of the rugged hill.   Many rock faces were imaged and probed along the way.  The above image captures not only a high and distant Mars inside Gusev crater, but also more of the refrigerator-sized Spirit rover than other similar vistas.

Seen towards the constellation Taurus it covers nearly 3 degrees (6 full moons) on the sky corresponding to a width of 150 light-years at the stellar debris cloud's estimated distance of 3,000 light-years. The above image is a color composite of 66 blue and red color band images from the National Geographic Palomar Observatory Sky Survey taken with the wide field Samuel Oschin 48-inch Telescope.  The area of the sky shown covers over 70 times the area of the full Moon. This supernova remnant has an apparent age of about 100,000 years - meaning light from the massive stellar explosion first reached Earth 100,000 years ago - but this expanding remnant is not the only aftermath. The cosmic catastrophe also left behind a spinning neutron star or pulsar, all that remains of the original star's core.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0511/simeis_demartin_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Simeis 147: Supernova Remnant from Palomar","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0511/simeis_demartin.jpg"},{"copyright":"Antilhue Observatory","date":"2005-11-30","explanation":"Sculpted by stellar winds and radiation, a magnificent interstellar dust cloud by chance has assumed this recognizable shape.  Fittingly named the Horsehead Nebula, it is some 1,500 light-years distant, embedded in the vast Orion cloud complex. About five light-years \"tall\", the dark cloud is cataloged as Barnard 33 and is visible only because its obscuring dust is silhouetted against the glowing red emission nebula IC 434.  Contrasting blue reflection nebula NGC 2023 is visible on the lower left.

Twelve sungazing instruments on board the spacecraft have explored the Sun's internal structure, the extensive solar atmosphere and solar wind, and discovered over 1,000 comets from a remarkable orbit around a point about 1.5 million kilometers directly sunward of planet Earth itself. At that location, known as a Lagrange point, the gravitational influence of the Earth and Sun are equal. With scientific instrument teams distributed around the world, the SOHO operations center is located at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Mission operations are planned through March of 2007 to allow the study of a complete 11-year solar cycle. Contributions from SOHO's instruments are represented in the colorful montage image.
