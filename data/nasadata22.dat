Open cluster NGC 3293 is located in the constellation Carina, lies at a distance of about 8000 light years, and has a particularly high abundance of these young bright stars.  A study of NGC 3293 implies that the blue stars are only about 6 million years old, whereas the cluster's dimmer, redder stars appear to be about 20 million years old.  If true, star formation in this open cluster took at least 15 million years.  Even this amount of time is short, however, when compared with the billions of years stars like our Sun live, and the over-ten billion year lifetimes of many galaxies and our universe.  NGC 3293 appears just in front of a dense dust lane emanating from the Carina Nebula.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/ngc3293_aao.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 3293: A Bright Young Open Cluster","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/ngc3293_aao_big.jpg"},{"date":"2001-09-10","explanation":"Why would the center of our Galaxy flicker?  Many astronomers believe the only credible answer involves a black hole.  During observations of Sagittarius A* with the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory, the bright X-ray source at the very center of our Milky Way brightened dramatically for a few minutes.  Sagittarius A* is visible as the bright dot near the center of the above image.  Since large objects cannot vary quickly, a small source is implicated in the variation.  Evidence including the motions of central stars indicates that the center of our Galaxy is a massive place, however, estimated to be over a million times the mass of our Sun.  Only one known type of object can fit so much mass in so small a volume: a black hole.  This short flicker therefore provides additional evidence that a black hole does indeed reside at our Galaxy's center.  If true, the flicker might have been caused by an object disrupting as it fell toward the disruptive monster.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/sgraflare_chandra.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Galactic Center Flicker Indicates Black Hole","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/sgraflare_chandra_big.jpg"},{"date":"2001-09-11","explanation":"The party is still going on in spiral galaxy NGC 3310.  Roughly 100 million years ago, NGC 3310 likely collided with a smaller galaxy causing the large spiral galaxy to light up with a tremendous burst of star formation.

The above image composite by the Hubble Space Telescope was used to find the ages of many of the resulting clusters of stars.  To the surprise of many, some of the clusters are quite young, indicating that starburst galaxies may remain in star-burst mode for quite some time.

Traveling at light speed the radio waves reach the ground simultaneously with visible light where they are strong enough to induce oscillating currents and audible vibrations in common objects like grass, leaves, wire-frame glasses, and perhaps even dry, frizzy hair.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0111/leonidfire_raymundo.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Meteor Storm Sights and Sounds","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0111/leonidfire_raymundo.gif"},{"date":"2001-12-01","explanation":"When NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft flew by distant Neptune in August of 1989, astronomers were shocked. Since Neptune receives only 3 percent the sunlight Jupiter does, they expected to find a dormant, dark, frigid planet. Instead, the Voyager images revealed evidence of a dynamic and turbulent world. One of the most spectacular discoveries was of the Great Dark Spot, shown here in close-up. Surprisingly, it was comparable in size and at the same relative southern latitude as Jupiter's Great Red Spot, appearing to be a similar rotating storm system. Winds near the spot were measured up to 1500 miles per hour, the strongest recorded on any planet. The Voyager data also revealed that the Great Dark Spot varied","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/nepspot_voyager2_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Neptune's Great Dark Spot: Gone But Not Forgotten","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/nepspot_voyager2.jpg"},{"date":"2001-12-02","explanation":"Three years ago results were first presented indicating that most of the energy in our universe is not in stars or galaxies but is tied to space itself.  In the language of cosmologists, a large cosmological constant is directly implied by new distant supernovae observations.  Suggestions of a cosmological constant (lambda) are not new -- they have existed since the advent of modern relativistic cosmology.  Such claims are not usually popular with astronomers, though, because lambda is so unlike known universe components, because lambda's value appears limited by other observations, and because less-strange cosmologies without lambda have previously done well in explaining the data.  What is noteworthy here is the seemingly direct and reliable method of the observations and the good reputations of the scientists conducting the investigations.  Over the past three years, two independent teams of astronomers have continued to accumulate data that appears to confirm the unsettling result.  The above picture of a supernova that occurred in 1994 on the outskirts of a spiral galaxy was taken by one of these collaborations.  Still, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and so cosmologists the world over continue to await more data and confirmation by independent methods.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/sn94d_hiz_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Rumors of a Strange Universe","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/sn94d_hiz.jpg"},{"copyright":"Phil Hoffman","date":"2001-12-03","explanation":"Tomorrow's picture: Star Flame  < | Archive | Index | Search | Calendar | Glossary | Education | About APOD | >  Authors & editors: Robert Nemiroff (MTU) & Jerry Bonnell (USRA) NASA Technical Rep.: Jay Norris.

Although surrounded by what may look like smoke, the object known as the \"flaming star\" creates energy primarily by nuclear fusion, like other stars.  Fire, typically defined as the rapid molecular acquisition of oxygen, happens only when sufficient oxygen is present and is not important in such high-energy, low-oxygen environments such as stars.  The material that appears as smoke is mostly interstellar hydrogen, but does contain smoke-like dark filaments of carbon-rich dust grains.  The AE Aurigae region was imaged by the KPNO 0.9-meter telescope and is shown above in false but representative colors.  The star AE Aurigae itself is very bright, young, blue, and known as a runaway star since it appears to have been ejected from the Orion Nebula region about 2.7 million years ago.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/aeaurigae_kpno_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"AE Aurigae: The Flaming Star","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/aeaurigae_kpno.jpg"},{"copyright":"Chen Huang-Ming","date":"2001-12-05","explanation":"In the early morning hours of November 19, amateur Chen Huang-Ming caught a sky filled with astronomical wonders.  With his fisheye camera set up on Ho-Huan Mountain in Taiwan for a half-hour exposure, he started the above image a local time of 2:33 am.  First, the many famous stars and nebulas captured are too numerous to count.  Planets Jupiter and Saturn are visible, while the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy sweeps diagonally across the image.  What makes this image most spectacular, however, are the over 100 bright meteors visible from the 2001 Leonids Meteor Shower.  The meteor shower is caused by the Earth plowing through a stream of sand-sized ice particles shed years ago by Comet Tempel-Tuttle.  Note that the meteors can all be tracked back to a radiant in the constellation Leo, the direction from which the particles orbit the Sun.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/leonids_chen_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Sky Filled with Leonids","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/leonids_chen.jpg"},{"date":"2001-12-06","explanation":"A comet bright enough to be seen with binoculars is swooping into southern skies.  Comet C/2000 WM1 (LINEAR) continues to brighten and develop tails as it nears its closest approach of the Sun in late January 2002.

In the above picture from the Curtis Schmidt 0.6-meter Telescope in Chile, a 30-second exposure in red on December 4 captured detail in Comet LINEAR WM1's emerging dust tail.  Optimistic sky watchers hope that Comet LINEAR WM1 will undergo an even greater (and unexpected) brightening to the point where its coma and tails are easily discernable to the unaided eye.  Comet LINEAR WM1 is being watched with particular interest by astronomers because its ion tail might yield clues to understanding the solar wind expelled from near the Sun's poles.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/linearwm1_ctio_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Comet Linear (WM1) Brightens","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/linearwm1_ctio.jpg"},{"copyright":"Tunc Tezel","date":"2001-12-07","explanation":"A road trip from Ankara to the Mediterranean coast southeast of Antalya, Turkey found clear skies and splendid scenery for astrophotographer Tunc Tezel's viewing of the 2001 Leonid meteor storm.

Lights from coastal dwellings and nearby islands are seen in the foreground with brilliant Sirius shining as the brightest star in the heavens, visible in the constellation Canis Major at the upper right. Many enthusiasts who made special trips to view this November's Leonids were rewarded with similar spectacles of the fireball-rich storm.

But only since 1999 have observers seen elusive optical flashes on the lunar surface - likely explosions resulting from impacting meteoroids. These startling observations were made with modest telescopes and video equipment during the 1999 and 2001 Leonid meteor showers. Six confirmed flashes, some initially as bright as a third magnitude star, were all seen within hours of the peak of the 1999 shower. At least two more lunar flashes, the brightest one at about fourth magnitude, have been confirmed during this November's Leonid storm. The 1999 locations are indicated by the red Xs on the dark lunar night side in this projection of the Moon from November 18 of that year. Similar flashes would have been difficult to see if viewed against the Moon's brightly lit portion. It is estimated that the flashes were made by meteoroids with masses in the range of 1 to 10 kilograms, producing craters a few meters across.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/moonstruck_palmer.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Moon Struck","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/moonstruck_palmer.jpg"}]
