The diminutive disk of Mercury, the solar system's innermost planet, spent about five hours crossing in front of the enormous solar disk on 2003 May 7, as viewed from the general vicinity of planet Earth. The Sun was above the horizon during the entire transit for observers in Europe, Africa, Asia, or Australia, and the horizon was certainly no problem for the sun-staring SOHO spacecraft. Seen as a dark spot, Mercury progresses from left to right (top panel to bottom) in these four images from SOHO's extreme ultraviolet camera. The panels' false-colors correspond to different wavelengths in the extreme ultraviolet which highlight regions above the Sun's visible surface. This was the first of 14 transits of Mercury which will occur during the 21st century, but the next similar event will be a much more rare transit of Venus this coming Tuesday.

Normal cloud bottoms are flat because moist warm air that rises and cools will condense into water droplets at a very specific temperature, which usually corresponds to a very specific height.  After water droplets form that air becomes an opaque cloud.  Under some conditions, however, cloud pockets can develop that contain large droplets of water or ice that fall into clear air as they evaporate.  Such pockets may occur in turbulent air near a thunderstorm, being seen near the top of an anvil cloud, for example.  Resulting mammatus clouds can appear especially dramatic if sunlit from the side.  The above mammatus clouds were photographed last month over Monclova, Mexico.

The Cassini spacecraft just entering orbit around Saturn has started sending back spectacular images of Saturn's immense ring system in unprecedented detail.  The physical cause for many of newly resolved ring structures is not always understood.   The cause for the beautifully geometric type of ring structure shown above in Saturn's A ring, however, is hypothesized to be a spiral density wave.  A small moon systematically perturbing the orbits of ring particles orbiting at slightly different distances causes such a density wave bunching.  Also visible on the image right is a bending wave, a vertical wave in ring particles also caused by the gravity of a nearby moon.  This close-up spans about 220 kilometers.

What is creating all of the methane?  To help answer these questions, the largest and most mysterious moon of Saturn got a quick first look from the Cassini robot spacecraft soon after entering orbit around the giant planet last week.  Although thick atmospheric smog prevented detailed surface images in visible light, infrared light was able to provide interesting clues to the nature of Titan's surface.  The above images show Titan in three different colors of infrared light, with the most energetic on the left.  The leftmost image is the most detailed but shows surface features that are not yet well understood.  The smoothness of the middle image is consistent with a large frozen ocean of water ice containing simple hydrocarbons.  The darker regions on the rightmost image might indicate areas relatively rich in hydrocarbons.  The white spot visible near the South Pole is hypothesized to be a persistent cloud of large particles containing methane.  A better understanding of the mysterious surface of Titan will hopefully be forthcoming as scientists study these images and those from a planned 45 flybys over the next four years.

The attraction is known as the Casimir Effect, named for its discoverer, who, 50 years ago, was trying to understand why fluids like mayonnaise move so slowly.  Today, evidence is accumulating that most of the energy density in the universe is in an unknown form dubbed dark energy.  The form and genesis of dark energy is almost completely unknown, but postulated as related to vacuum fluctuations similar to the Casimir Effect but generated somehow by space itself.  This vast and mysterious dark energy appears to gravitationally repel all matter and hence will likely cause the universe to expand forever.

A full lunation takes about 29.5 days, just under a month (moon-th).","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9911/lunation_ajc.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Lunation","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9911/lunation_ajc_big.gif"},{"copyright":"Mike Holloway","date":"2004-08-30","explanation":"A comet discovered last year has brightened unexpectedly and now may become visible to the unaided eye within the next month.  Designated Comet C/2003 K4 (LINEAR), the comet was discovered in 2003 May by project LINEAR.  Many reports already place the comet as brighter than magnitude 7, meaning that it can now be seen with binoculars.  Reports also indicate the comet already has a visible tail nearly the length of a full Moon.  Since predicting the future brightness of comets is a very tricky business, there remains the possibility that K4 might never become very bright.  Current predictions, however, estimate the comet may approach fifth magnitude in October.  K4 passes closest to the Sun on October 12 and then closest to the Earth on December 23.  Comet K4 was photographed above from Van Buren, Arkansas, USA on August 17.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0408/c2003k4_mfh_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Announcing Comet C/2003 K4 (LINEAR)","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0408/c2003k4_mfh.jpg"},{"copyright":"Malin Space Science SystemsMOCMGSJPLNASA","date":"2004-08-31","explanation":"What causes the black dots on dunes on Mars?  As spring dawns on the Northern Hemisphere of Mars, dunes of sand near the poles begin to defrost.  Thinner regions of ice typically thaw first revealing sand whose darkness soaks in sunlight and accelerates the thaw.  By summer, the spots will have expanded to encompass the entire dunes that will then be completely thawed and dark. The carbon dioxide and water ice actually sublime in the thin atmosphere directly to gas.  Taken in mid-July, the above image shows a field of spotted polar dunes spanning about 3 kilometers near the Martian North Pole.  Meanwhile, in the Southern Hemisphere of Mars, the Earth-sent robot Martian rovers will try to survive through Martian winter, which peaks in mid-September.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0408/dotteddunes_mgs_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Dotted Dunes of Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0408/dotteddunes_mgs.jpg"},{"date":"2004-09-01","explanation":"Is our Solar System unique?  The discovery of a Neptune-mass planet in an sub-Mercury orbit around nearby Sun-like star 55 Cancri, announced yesterday along with the discovery of other similar systems, gives a new indication that planetary systems as complex as our own  Solar System likely exist elsewhere.  The planet, discovered in data from the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas, the Lick Observatory in California, and the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, is one of four planets now known to orbit  55 Cancri -- the others being similar in mass to Jupiter.  The finding involved noting subtle changes in the speed of the star caused by its orbiting planets.  The above drawing depicts what this planet might look like, assuming a mass similar to Neptune, but a composition similar to Earth.  The star 55 Cancri, only 40 light-years distant, is visible with binoculars towards the constellation of Cancer.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0409/newneptune_nasa_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"An Inner Neptune for 55 Cancri","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0409/newneptune_nasa.jpg"},{"copyright":"StarryScapes","date":"2004-09-02","explanation":"Portuguese navigator Fernando de Magellan and his crew had plenty of time to study the southern sky during the first circumnavigation of planet Earth. As a result, two fuzzy cloud-like objects easily visible for southern hemisphere skygazers are known as the Clouds of Magellan. Of course, these star clouds are now understood to be dwarf irregular galaxies, satellites of our larger spiral Milky Way galaxy. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) pictured above is only about 180,000 light-years distant in the constellation Dorado. Spanning about 15,000 light-years or so, it is the most massive of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies and is the site of the closest supernova in modern times.  The prominent red knot on the right is 30 Doradus, or the Tarantula Nebula, a giant star-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0409/lmc_tan_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Large Cloud of Magellan","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0409/lmc_tan_c1.jpg"},{"date":"2004-09-03","explanation":"A major hurricane is heading for Florida.  Hurricane Frances, one of the stronger storm systems of modern times, may cross the eastern coast of Florida sometime tomorrow.  Those in the path of a hurricane should take precautions.  For example, NASA's Kennedy Space Center has completely shut down.  The orbiting GOES-12 satellite took the above image of Hurricane Frances early yesterday. Hurricanes are huge swirling storms with cloud systems typically larger than a state.  Tropical cyclones, called hurricanes in Earth's Western Hemisphere and typhoons in the Eastern Hemisphere, get their immense energy from warm evaporated ocean water.  As this water vapor cools and condenses, it heats the air, lowers pressure and hence causes cooler air to come swooshing in.  Winds can reach over 250 kilometers per hour and become very dangerous.  Much remains unknown about cyclones, including how they are formed and the exact path they will take.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0409/frances2_noaa_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Hurricane Frances Approaches Florida","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0409/frances2_noaa.jpg"},{"date":"2004-09-04","explanation":"Looking for water on Mars, researchers using detectors on board the orbiting Mars Odyssey spacecraft have created this false-color global map of energetic neutrons from the otherwise Red Planet. What do neutrons have to do with water? As cosmic rays from interplanetary space penetrate the thin martian atmosphere and reach the surface they interact with elements in the upper layer of soil, scattering neutrons back into space. But if the martian soil contains hydrogen, it seriously absorbs energetic scattered neutrons. Tracking variations in absorption, neutron detectors can map changes in surface hydrogen content from orbit. Hydrogen content is taken as a surrogate measure of frozen water (H20), the most likely form of hydrogen close to the martian surface. Thus, bluer shades in the above map correspond to larger presumed concentrations of near-surface water ice. Water ice at the martian poles came as no surprise, but significant concentrations also seem to be present at lower latitudes. The melting of such near-surface ice could be responsible for the formation of martian gullies.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0409/neutronMars_odyssey_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Neutron Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0409/neutronMars_odyssey_c1.jpg"}]
