Gas at the inner edge of this disk is so close to the black hole that it moves unusually fast -- at 10 percent of the speed of light. Gas this fast shows relativistic beaming, making the side of the disk heading toward us appear significantly brighter than the side moving away.

Although the precise dynamics behind the featured image is yet unclear, what is clear is that the pictured galaxy, NGC 7714, has been stretched and distorted by a recent collision with a neighboring galaxy. This smaller neighbor, NGC 7715, situated off to the left of the featured frame, is thought to have charged right through NGC 7714. Observations indicate that the golden ring pictured is composed of millions of older Sun-like stars that are likely co-moving with the interior bluer stars. In contrast, the bright center of NGC 7714 appears to be undergoing a burst of new star formation.  The featured image was captured by the  Hubble Space Telescope.  NGC 7714 is located about 130 million light years away toward the constellation of the Two Fish (Pisces).  The interactions between these galaxies likely started about 150 million years ago and should continue for several hundred million years more, after which a single central galaxy may result.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1910/Ngc7714_HubblePohl_2048.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 7714: Starburst after Galaxy Collision","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1910/Ngc7714_HubblePohl_1080.jpg"},{"copyright":"Eric Wagner","date":"2019-10-10","explanation":"On September 24, a late evening commercial flight from Singapore to Australia offered stratospheric views of the southern hemisphere's night sky, if you chose a window seat.

Also known as M8, this photogenic nebula is visible even without binoculars towards the constellation of the Archer (Sagittarius). The energetic processes of star formation create not only the colors but the chaos. The glowing gas results from high-energy starlight striking interstellar hydrogen gas and trace amounts of sulfur, and oxygen gases. The dark dust filaments that lace M8 were created in the atmospheres of cool giant stars and in the debris from supernovae explosions. The light from M8 we see today left about 5,000 years ago.

If you estimated each spiral's mass by how much light it emits, their fast rotations should break them apart.  The leading hypothesis as to why these galaxies don't break apart is dark matter -- mass so dark we can't see it. But these galaxies are even out-spinning this break-up limit -- they are the fastest rotating disk galaxies known.  It is therefore further hypothesized that their dark matter halos are so massive -- and their spins so fast -- that it is harder for them to form stars than regular spirals. If so, then these galaxies may be among the most massive spirals possible. Further study of surprising super-spirals like these will continue, likely including observations taken by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope scheduled for launch in 2021.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1911/SuperSpirals_HubbleSDSS_1777.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Spiral Galaxies Spinning Super-Fast","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1911/SuperSpirals_HubbleSDSS_1080.jpg"},{"date":"2019-11-06","explanation":"One of the last entries in Charles Messier's famous catalog, big, beautiful spiral galaxy M101 is definitely not one of the least.

M101 was also one of the original spiral nebulae observed with Lord Rosse's large 19th century telescope, the Leviathan of Parsonstown. In contrast, this multiwavelength view of the large island universe is a composite of images recorded by space-based telescopes in the 21st century.

The sister stars and cosmic dust cloud are not related though, they just happen to be passing through the same region of space. Known since antiquity as a compact grouping of stars, Galileo first sketched the star cluster viewed through his telescope with stars too faint to be seen by eye.  Charles Messier recorded the position of the cluster as the 45th entry in his famous catalog of things which are not comets.

Its development directed by rocket pioneer Wernher Von Braun, the three stage Saturn V stood over 36 stories tall. It had a cluster of five first stage engines fueled by liquid oxygen and kerosene which together were capable of producing 7.9 million pounds of thrust. Giant Saturn V rockets ultimately hurled nine Apollo missions to the Moon and back again with six landing on the lunar surface.

Pictured here is a lunar panorama taken from Earth featuring the large craters Langrenus, toward the left, and Petavius, toward the right. The craters formed in separate impacts. Langrenus spans about 130 km, has a terraced rim, and sports a central peak rising about 3 km.  Petavius is slightly larger with a 180 km diameter and has a distinctive fracture that runs out from its center. Although it is known that Petravius crater is about 3.9 billion years old, the origin of its large fracture is unknown.  The craters are best visible a few days after a new Moon, when shadows most greatly accentuate vertical walls and hills.

Most bright stars in spiral galaxies swirl around the center in a disk, and seen from the side, this disk can appear quite thin.  Some spiral galaxies appear even thinner than NGC 3717, which is actually seen tilted just a bit.  Spiral galaxies form disks because the original gas collided with itself and cooled as it fell inward.  Planets may orbit in disks for similar reasons.  The featured image by the Hubble Space Telescope shows a light-colored central bulge composed of older stars beyond filaments of orbiting dark brown dust.
