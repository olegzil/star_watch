Actually, the Earth itself does not, but the aurora high in the Earth's atmosphere do glow with x-rays detectable by space-based instruments.

Such dust storms are not uncommon as summer advances in the north.  In the above picture taken by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft currently orbiting Mars, the white material is frozen carbon dioxide that covers much of the extreme north.  As the north polar cap region begins to thaw, a temperature difference occurs between the cold frost region and recently thawed surface, resulting in swirling winds between the adjacent regions.  Visible in the storm is a strong central jet about 900 kilometers long that is creating symmetric swirling vortices.

Hot gas, colored pink, is being ejected out of the spiral galaxy from the central region.  Much of Circinus' tumultuous gas, however, is concentrated in two rings.  The outer ring, located about 700 light-years from the center, appears mostly red and is home to tremendous bursts of star formation.  A previously unseen inner ring, inside the green disk above, is visible only 130 light years from the center on this recently released, representative color image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.  At the very center is an active galactic nucleus, where matter glows brightly before likely spiraling into a massive black hole.  Although only 15 million light years distant, the Circinus Galaxy went unnoticed until 25 years ago because it is so obscured by material in the plane of our own Galaxy.  The galaxy can be seen with a small telescope, however, in the constellation of Circinus.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0012/circinus_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Circinus Galaxy","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0012/circinus_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2000-12-05","explanation":"Pictured above, layers upon layers stretch across the floor of West Candor Chasma within the immense martian Valles Marineris. Covering an area 1.5 by 2.9 kilometers, the full image from the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft shows over 100 individual beds. Each strikingly uniform layer is smooth, hard enough to form steep edges, and is 10 to 11 meters thick. In a press conference yesterday scientists Michael Malin and Ken Edgett presented this and other new images which show that the layered patterns exist at widespread locations near the martian equator. Their results indicate that some of the layered regions may be 3.5 billion years old. On planet Earth, layered patterns like these are formed from sediment deposited over time by large bodies of water. Likewise, the layered beds on Mars may be sedimentary rock formed in ancient lakes and seas. The researchers caution, however, that other uniquely martian processes may be responsible for the layering. Did life arise on ancient Mars? Because of their possible association with water, a prime location for future searches for fossil remains of martian life would be within these layers of Mars.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0012/candorlayers_mgs_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Layered Mars: An Ancient Water World?","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0012/candorlayers_mgs1.jpg"},{"date":"2000-12-06","explanation":"Tomorrow's picture: Faulty Earth  < | Archive | Index | Search | Calendar | Glossary | Education | About APOD | >  Authors & editors: Robert Nemiroff (MTU) & Jerry Bonnell (USRA) NASA Technical Rep.: Jay Norris.

Cracks in the Earth's crust known as faults can run for hundreds of kilometers.  These faults are frequently the sites of major earthquakes as the tectonic plates that cover the surface of the Earth shift. Pictured above is San Andreas Fault in California, one of the longest and most active faults.  Visible as the linear feature to the right of the mountains, San Andreas Fault reaches 15 kilometers deep and is about 20 million years old.  The above exaggerated-height image was created by combining radar deployed by the Space Shuttle Endeavour in February with a true-color Landsat picture.  Along San Andreas Fault, the titanic Pacific Plate is shifting relative to the huge North American Plate by an average of a few centimeters per year.  At that rate, in a few million years, the Earth's surface will look quite different than it does today.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0012/sanandreasfault_srtm_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Earth's San Andreas Fault","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0012/sanandreasfault_srtm.jpg"},{"date":"2000-12-08","explanation":"Throughout the Universe, galaxies tend to swarm in groups ranging from just a handful of members to casts of thousands. Astronomers have realized since the early 1970s that the larger swarms, immense clusters of galaxies millions of light-years across, are immersed within tenuous clouds of hot gas which glow strongly in x-rays.  These clouds may have been heated by their collapse in the early Universe, but in many galaxy clusters, the gas appears to be cooling. This Chandra Observatory x-ray image reveals a striking cooling flow in the central regions of the galaxy cluster cataloged as Abell 1795. Brighter pixels in the false-color image represent higher x-ray intensities. The bright filament down the center indicates gas condensing and cooling -- rapidly loosing energy by radiating x-rays. At the very top of the filament is a large, x-ray bright galaxy. As it moved through the cluster gas cloud, the massive galaxy's gravitational influence seems to have created this cosmic wake of denser, cooling gas. Continuing to cool, the cluster gas will ultimately provide raw material to form future generations of stars.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0012/abell1795_cxc_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Abell 1795: A Galaxy Cluster's Cooling Flow","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0012/abell1795_cxc.jpg"},{"date":"2000-12-09","explanation":"Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 11 Lunar Module pilot and the second human to walk on the Moon, described the lunar landscape as \"a magnificent desolation\".
