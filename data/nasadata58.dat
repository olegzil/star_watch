In the disk of our Milky Way Galaxy about 10 percent of visible matter is in the form of gas, called the interstellar medium (ISM).  The ISM is not uniform, and shows patchiness even near our Sun.  It can be quite difficult to detect the local ISM because it is so tenuous and emits so little light.  This mostly hydrogen gas, however, absorbs some very specific colors that can be detected in the light of the nearest stars.  A working map of the local ISM within 10 light-years based on recent observations is shown above.  These observations show that our Sun is moving through a Local Interstellar Cloud as this cloud flows outwards from the Scorpius-Centaurus Association star forming region.  Our Sun may exit the Local Interstellar Cloud, also called the Local Fluff, during the next 10,000 years.  Much remains unknown about the local ISM, including details of its distribution, its origin, and how it affects the Sun and the Earth.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1008/localcloud_frisch_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Local Fluff","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1008/localcloud_frisch.jpg"},{"date":"2010-08-30","explanation":"Could life once have survived on Mars? Today, neither animal nor plant life from Earth could survive for very long on Mars because at least one key ingredient -- liquid water -- is essentially absent on the red planet's rusty surface. Although evidence from the martian rovers indicates that long ago Mars might once have had liquid water on its surface, that water might also have been too acidic for familiar life forms to thrive.  Recently, however, a newly detailed analysis of an unusual outcropping of rock and soil chanced upon in 2005 by the robotic Spirit rover has uncovered a clue indicating that not all of Mars was always so acidic. The mound in question, dubbed Comanche Outcrop and visible near the top of the above image, appears to contain unusually high concentrations of elements such as magnesium iron carbonate. The above image is shown in colors exaggerated to highlight the differences in composition. Since these carbonates dissolve in acid, the persistence of these mounds indicates that water perhaps less acidic and more favorable for life might have once flowed across Mars. More detailed analyses and searches for other signs will surely continue.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1008/comancheoutcrop_spirit_big_annotated.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Comanche Outcrop on Mars Indicates Hospitable Past","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1008/comancheoutcrop_spirit.jpg"},{"copyright":"Jaime Fernandez","date":"2010-08-31","explanation":"The sky toward the center of our Galaxy is filled with a wide variety of celestial wonders, many of which are visible from a dark location with common binoculars.

Fortunately, this is not meant to be the first step in a Galactic war.  Rather, astronomers at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) site in Chile are trying to measure the distortions of Earth's ever changing atmosphere.  Constant imaging of high-altitude atoms excited by the laser -- which appear like an artificial star -- allow astronomers to instantly measure atmospheric blurring.  This information is fed back to a VLT telescope mirror which is then slightly deformed to minimize this blurring.  In this case, a VLT was observing our Galaxy's center, and so Earth's atmospheric blurring in that direction was needed.  As for inter-galaxy warfare, when viewed from our Galaxy's center, no casualties are expected.

To help find out, scientists have sorted through hundreds of infrared images of Saturn taken by the Cassini spacecraft for other purposes, trying to find enough aurora images to correlate changes and make movies. Once made, some movies clearly show that Saturnian auroras can change not only with the angle of the Sun, but also as the planet rotates. Furthermore, some auroral changes appear related to waves in Saturn's magnetosphere likely caused by Saturn's moons. Pictured above, a false-colored image taken in 2007 shows Saturn in three bands of infrared light.

In the above recently released image sequence taken in infrared light and digitally compressed, darker areas correspond to higher temperatures and hence lower regions of Venus' atmosphere.

Now a team headed by Steven Vogt (UCO Lick), and Paul Butler (DTM Carnagie Inst.) has announced the detection of another planet, this one squarely in the system's habitable zone.

The particles don't follow Prometheus so much as glide sideways past where Prometheus used to be. One dark streamer is created during each pass of Prometheus through the F-ring that it shepherds. The streamers were unpredicted and first discovered in 2004 on high resolution images taken by the robotic Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn.  Close inspection of the surface of Prometheus itself in the above image shows interesting structure and craters.

If one or more of the multiverse hypotheses is correct, then quite possibly they do.  In the above computer-enhanced illustration, independent universes are shown as independent circles or spheres.  Spheres may be causally disconnected from all other spheres, meaning no communications can pass between them.  Some spheres may contain different realizations of our universe, while others may have different physical laws.  An entire set of parallel universes is called a multiverse.  The human eye might represent the possibility that realizations of some multiverse hypotheses might only exist in the human mind. One criticism of multiverse hypotheses is that they are frequently difficult to test.  Some multiverse hypotheses may therefore be great fun to think about but not practically  falsifiable and therefore have no predictive scientific value.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1011/universes_pickover_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Multiverses: Do Other Universes Exist?","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1011/universes_pickover.jpg"},{"date":"2010-11-15","explanation":"There's no place like home.

About 350 kilometers up, the ISS is high enough so that the Earth's horizon appears clearly curved. Astronaut Dyson's windows show some of Earth's complex clouds, in white, and life giving atmosphere and oceans, in blue. The space station orbits the Earth about once every 90 minutes. It is not difficult for people living below to look back toward the ISS.  The ISS can frequently be seen as a bright point of light drifting overhead just after sunset.

Comet Hartley 2 became active recently as it neared the Sun and sunlight warmed the comet. Preliminary analyses of images like that shown above indicate that the smooth regions around the middle are porous and leak frozen water vapor directly out into space.  Unexpectedly, however, the rough regions at either end appear to shoot carbon dioxide jets that expel fluffy snowballs, some as large as basketballs, from the nucleus.  Many of the dots in the above image are thought to be snowballs.

Solar activity like this typically expels charged particles into the Solar System, some of which may trigger Earthly auroras. As this year unfolded, the above timelapse displays of picturesque auroras were captured above Troms\ufffd, Norway.
