On the upper left, a galaxy appears to be breaking up into small pieces, while on the far right, another galaxy appears to be stretched like taffy.  To start, most of the yellowish objects in the above image from the Hubble Space Telescope are galactic members of a massive cluster of galaxies known as Abell 2667.  The distortion of the galaxy on the upper left is real.  As the galaxy plows through the intercluster medium, gas is stripped out and condenses to form bright new knots of stars.  This detailed image of ram pressure stripping helps astronomers understand why so many galaxies today have so little gas. The distortion of the galaxy on the far right, however, is an illusion.  This nearly normal galaxy is actually far behind the massive galaxy cluster.  Light from this galaxy is gravitationally lensed by Abell 2667, appearing much like a distant person would appear through a wine glass.

The quasar must be properly aligned behind the center of a massive galaxy for a mirage like this to be evident.

What intrigues many astronomers, however, is the circumnuclear ring around the galaxy center visible just outside the central bar.  Recent images by the Chandra X-ray Observatory have shown that X-ray light surrounding the ring is likely emission from recent supernovas.  Although the long term stability of the ring remains a topic of research, recent observations indicate its present brightness is at least enhanced by transient bursts of star formation.

Although noted for thousands of years, sunspots have been known for decades to be regions of the Sun that are slightly depressed and cooled by the Sun's complex and changing magnetic field. High resolution pictures like the above image from Japan's new Sun-watching Hinode satellite, however, are helping to increase modern understanding.  In the center of the above image is a sunspot, but not seen in the usual orientation --this sunspot is seen sideways.  Of particular interest is erupting glowing gas that shows how the Sun's magnetic field comes right out of the spot center, but curves markedly around the spot edges.  Better understanding of how the Sun ejects particles into space may result in more accurate predictions of solar storms that affect satellites, astronauts, and even power grids on Earth.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0704/sidespot_hinode_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"An Active Sunspot Viewed Sideways","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0704/sidespot_hinode.jpg"},{"date":"2007-04-03","explanation":"Why would clouds form a hexagon on Saturn?

Although Earth's Moon passes Venus once each month, such a close passing visible in the evening sky is more rare.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/venusmoon_ouellet_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Venus Near the Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/venusmoon_ouellet.jpg"},{"copyright":"Neil Fleming","date":"2007-05-24","explanation":"This expansive (1-degree wide) telescopic view looks out along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy toward the nebula rich constellation Cygnus the Swan. It is centered on a bright hydrogen emission region recorded in the 1959 catalog by astronomer Stewart Sharpless as Sh2-101. About 8,000 light-years distant the nebula is popularly known as the Tulip Nebula, understandably not the only cosmic cloud to evoke the imagery of flowers. Complex and beautiful in visible light, the area also includes one of the brightest, most famous sources in the x-ray sky, Cygnus X-1. Discovered in the early 1970s, Cygnus X-1 is a bizarre binary system consisting of a massive, hot, supergiant star (seen here) in close orbit with a stellar mass black hole. The Cygnus X-1 system is also estimated to lie a comfortable 8,000 light-years away.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/tulip_fleming.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Tulip in the Swan","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/tulip_fleming720.jpg"},{"copyright":"Jimmy WestlakeColorado\nMountain College","date":"2007-05-25","explanation":"In this gorgeous skyscape, gas giant Jupiter along with the stars and cosmic dust clouds of the Milky Way hang over the southern horizon in the early morning hours as seen from Stagecoach, Colorado, USA. Recorded on Thursday, Jupiter is the brightest object near picture center. Along with the stunning Milky Way, Jupiter is hard to miss, but a careful inspection of the view also reveals main belt asteroid Vesta. Of all the asteroids Vesta is the brightest and is now just bright enough to be visible to the naked eye from locations with very dark, clear skies. Vesta (as well as Jupiter) appears relatively bright now because it is near opposition, literally opposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky and closest to Earth in its orbit. For Vesta, this opposition offers the best viewing in many years. The year 2007 also coincides with the 200th anniversary of the asteroid's discovery. Starting late next month, NASA plans to launch the Dawn mission intended to explore Vesta (and Ceres) and the main asteroid belt.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/JupiterVesta052407_westlake.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Jupiter, Vesta, and the Milky Way","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/JupiterVesta052407_westlake720.jpg"},{"copyright":"Jens Hackmann","date":"2007-05-26","explanation":"On May 22nd, just days after sharing the western evening sky with Venus, the Moon moved on to Saturn - actually passing in front of the ringed planet when viewed in skies over Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia. Because the Moon and bright planets wander through the sky near the ecliptic plane, such occultation events are not uncommon, but they are dramatic, especially in telescopic views. For example, in this sharp image Saturn is captured emerging from behind the Moon, giving the illusion that it lies just beyond the Moon's bright edge. Of course, the Moon is a mere 400 thousand kilometers away, compared to Saturn's distance of 1.4 billion kilometers. Taken with a digital camera and 20 inch diameter telescope at the Weikersheim Observatory in southern Germany, the picture is a single exposure adjusted to reduce the difference in brightness between Saturn and the cratered lunar surface.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/saturnoccultation_hackmann.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Moon's Saturn","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/saturnoccultation_hackmann720.jpg"},{"copyright":"Nigel Sharp","date":"2007-05-27","explanation":"One of the most identifiable nebulae in the sky, the Horsehead Nebula in Orion, is part of a large, dark, molecular cloud.  Also known as Barnard 33, the unusual shape was first discovered on a photographic plate in the late 1800s.  The red glow originates from hydrogen gas predominantly behind the nebula, ionized by the nearby bright star Sigma Orionis.  The darkness of the Horsehead is caused mostly by thick dust, although the lower part of the Horsehead's neck casts a shadow to the left.  Streams of gas leaving the nebula are funneled by a strong magnetic field.  Bright spots in the Horsehead Nebula's base are young stars just in the process of forming.  Light takes about 1500 years to reach us from the Horsehead Nebula.   The above image was taken with the 0.9-meter telescope at  Kitt Peak National Observatory.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/horsehead_noao_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Horsehead Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/horsehead_noao.jpg"},{"date":"2007-05-28","explanation":"Black spots have been discovered on Mars that are so dark that nothing inside can be seen. Quite possibly, the spots are entrances to deep underground caves capable of protecting Martian life, were it to exist.  The unusual hole pictured above was found on the slopes of the giant Martian volcano Arsia Mons. The above image was captured three weeks ago by the HiRISE instrument onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter currently circling Mars.  The holes were originally identified on lower resolution images from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft, The above hole is about the size of a football field and is so deep that it is completely unilluminated by the Sun.  Such holes and underground caves might be prime targets for future spacecraft, robots, and even the next generation of human interplanetary explorers.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/marshole_hirise_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Hole in Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/marshole_hirise.jpg"},{"date":"2007-05-29","explanation":"The Hubble Space Telescope has resolved individual stars in a spectacular new image of nearby spiral galaxy M81.  The feat is similar to Edwin Hubble's historic images with the Mt. Wilson 100-inch Hooker Telescope in the 1920s that resolved stars in neighboring galaxy M31.  Edwin Hubble was able to use individual Cepheid variable stars to show that M31 was not nearby swirling gas but rather an entire galaxy like our Milky Way Galaxy.   This above image in visible light taken by the Hubble Space Telescope is being used in conjunction with images being taken in ultraviolet by Galex, infrared by Spitzer, and X-rays with Chandra to study how stars have formed and died over the history M81.

Quite possible a sea of liquid hydrocarbons. The region was imaged earlier this month when the robotic Cassini spacecraft swooped past Saturn's cloudy moon and illuminated part of it with radar.  The dark region in the above image reflected little radar, an effect expected were the dark surface relatively flat, as expected for a liquid.   Other indications that the vast dark area is liquid include the coastline-like topology of the brighter regions, which appear to include islands, inlets, and tributary channels. The uninterrupted smoothness of much of the dark sea may indicate that the sea runs deep, with speculation holding a depth estimate of tens of meters. A hydrocarbon sea on Titan holds particular interest for exobiologists as it might be a place where life could develop.  In 2005 the Huygens probe landed on Titan and returned the first surface images.  Cassini will continue to explore Titan, as 13 more flybys are planned.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/titansea_cassini_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Liquid Sea on Saturn's Titan","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/titansea_cassini.jpg"},{"date":"2007-05-31","explanation":"In visible light images, over a thousand galaxies are seen to lie within a volume about 20 million light-years across in the rich Coma Galaxy Cluster. But infrared images of the Coma Cluster have now been used to add thousands more to the Coma's galaxy count in the form of previously undiscovered dwarf galaxies. This composite combines infrared Spitzer Space Telescope image data (red and green) with visible light Sloan Sky Survey data (blue) for the central part of the cluster. Over 1 degree wide, the field is dominated by two giant elliptical galaxies in blue. Still, many of the small green smudges (see magnified inset) are identified as dwarf galaxies, roughly comparable to the Small Magellanic Cloud. Dwarf galaxies are thought to form first, providing building blocks for larger galaxies.

It's also a member of a picturesque trio of large spiral galaxies known as the Leo Triplet, about 35 million light-years away. This sharp view of M65 shows off the galaxy in remarkable detail, with tightly wound spiral arms and dust lanes stretching into a core dominated by the yellowish light from an older population of stars.  In fact, M65 seems to be the least disturbed of the Leo Trio, though it is close enough to be interacting gravitationally with the other two galaxies (not seen here). Very nearly edge-on to our line-of-sight, M65 is about 100,000 light-years across, similar in size to our Milky Way Galaxy.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0706/m65_wendel.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Messier 65","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0706/m65_wendel_c720.jpg"},{"copyright":"PixHeaven.net","date":"2007-06-02","explanation":"Get out your red/blue glasses and check out this satisfying stereo anaglyph of the Full Moon. A corresponding stereo image pair, intended for cross-eyed viewing, is also available through this link. Regardless of your preferred technique for stereo viewing, the 3D effect comes from combining pictures of the same scene taken at different angles -- mimicking the slightly different perspective of each eye. Perhaps surprisingly for Earthdwellers, getting two pictures of the Full Moon from different angles only requires a little patience. In this case, photographer Laurent Laveder used pictures taken months apart, one in November 2006 and one in January 2007. He relied on the Moon's continuous libration or wobble as it orbits to produce two shifted images of a Full Moon.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0706/3dfullmoon0611-0701_laveder.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"3D Full Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0706/3dfullmoon0611-0701_laveder720.jpg"}]
