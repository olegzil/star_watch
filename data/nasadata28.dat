A striking example is M101, shown above, whose relatively close distance of about 22 million light years allow it to be studied in some detail.  Recent evidence indicates that a close gravitational interaction with a neighboring galaxy created waves of high mass and condensed gas which continue to orbit the galaxy center.  These waves compress existing gas and cause star formation.  One result is that M101, also called the Pinwheel Galaxy, has several extremely bright star-forming regions (called HII regions) spread across its spiral arms.  M101 is so large that its immense gravity distorts smaller nearby galaxies.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/m101_cfht_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"M101: The Pinwheel Galaxy","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/m101_cfht.jpg"},{"copyright":"Arne Danielsen","date":"2003-03-11","explanation":"Why would clouds appear to be different colors?  A relatively rare phenomenon known as iridescent clouds can show unusual colors vividly or a whole spectrum of colors simultaneously.  These clouds are formed of small water droplets of nearly uniform size.  When the Sun is in the right position and mostly hidden by thick clouds, these thinner clouds significantly diffract sunlight in a nearly coherent manner, with different colors being deflected by different amounts.  Therefore, different colors will come to the observer from slightly different directions.  Many clouds start with uniform regions that could show iridescence but quickly become too thick, too mixed, or too far from the Sun to exhibit striking colors. Pictured above, iridescent clouds were photographed over Norway two months ago.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/IridescentCloud_danielsen_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Iridescent Clouds","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/IridescentCloud_danielsen.jpg"},{"date":"2003-03-12","explanation":"The far side of the Moon is rough and filled with craters.  By comparison, the near side of the Moon, the side we always see, is relatively smooth.  Since the Moon is rotation locked to always point the same side toward Earth, humanity has only glimpsed the lunar farside recently -- last century.  The light highlands of the far side are older than the dark Maria of the near side.  A thinner crust on the near side that allowed for more dark lava flows is thought to be the cause of differences between the two sides.  The cause for the crust thickness differences is still being researched, however.  The large impact basin pictured above is Crater 308.  It spans about 30 kilometers and was photographed by crew of Apollo 11 as they circled the Moon in 1969.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/lunarfarside_apollo11_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Lunar Farside from Apollo 11","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/lunarfarside_apollo11.jpg"},{"date":"2003-03-13","explanation":"Gazing out over the mountaintops from the Wyoming InfraRed Observatory (WIRO), astronomers recently recorded this bizarre looking image of the solar system's ruling planet, gas giant Jupiter. The false-color picture is a composite of images taken to test a sophisticated digital camera operating at liquid helium temperatures and sensitive to wavelengths about three times longer than visible red light. At those infrared wavelengths (near 2.1 microns) the molecular hydrogen and methane gas in Jupiter's dense lower atmosphere strongly absorb sunlight, so the normally bright, banded planet looks very dark. But particles and haze over the equator and poles rise above the absorbing layers into Jupiter's stratosphere and reflect the infrared sunlight. Also clearly extending into the Jovian stratosphere is the famous Great Red Spot seen here in yellow just under the equatorial band at the right. North is up in this view and Jupiter's rapid 10 hour rotation will soon carry the Great Red Spot behind the planet's right limb.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/jupiter_wiro8_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"WIRO at Jupiter","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/jupiter_wiro8_full.jpg"},{"date":"2003-03-14","explanation":"Large, massive stars end their furious lives in spectacular supernova explosions -- but small, low mass stars may encounter a similar fate. In fact, instead of simply cooling off and quietly fading away, some white dwarf stars in binary star systems are thought to draw enough mass from their companions to become unstable, triggering a nuclear detonation. The resulting standard candle stellar explosion is classified as a Type Ia supernova and perhaps the best example yet of the aftermath is this expanding cloud of shocked stellar debris, DEM L71, in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud. The sharp false-color x-ray image from the orbiting Chandra Observatory shows the predicted bright edges of the outer blast wave shock region and the x-ray glow of an inner region of reverse shock heated gas. Based on the Chandra data, estimates for the composition and total mass of expanding gas strongly suggest that this is all that remains of a white dwarf star. Light from this small star's self-destructive explosion would have first reached Earth several thousand years ago.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/deml71_cxc_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"DEM L71: When Small Stars Explode","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/deml71_cxc_c1.jpg"},{"date":"2003-03-15","explanation":"Is it art? In November of 1969, Apollo 12 astronaut-photographer Charles \"Pete\" Conrad recorded this masterpiece while documenting colleague Alan Bean's lunar soil collection activities on the Oceanus Procellarum. The image is dramatic and stark. Bean is faceless. The harsh environment of the Moon's Ocean of Storms is echoed in his helmet's perfectly composed reflection of Conrad and the lunar horizon. Works of photojournalists originally intent on recording the human condition on planet Earth, such as Lewis W. Hine's images from New York City in the early 20th century, or Margaret Bourke-White's magazine photography are widely regarded as art.

Discovered in 1783 by Caroline Herschel in the constellation of Sculptor, NGC 253 lies only about ten million light-years distant.  NGC 253 is the largest member of the Sculptor Group of Galaxies, the nearest group to our own  Local Group of Galaxies.  The dense dark dust accompanies a high star formation rate, giving NGC 253 the designation of starburst galaxy.

Over the course of just a few days, the rogue star became brighter than the planet Venus.  The star, likely the talk of everyone who could see it, was recorded by people who lived in areas now known as China, Egypt, Iraq, Italy, Japan, and Switzerland.  The celestial newcomer, now known to be a supernova, took months to fade.  Modern observations have been used to measure the speed of the still-expanding shock wave, allowing a better estimate of its distance and hence a better estimate of the true brightness of the supernova.  It turns out SN 1006 likely achieved an apparent visual magnitude of -7.5, making it the brightest supernova on record.  The shock wave was imaged in 1998 from CTIO (left panel), and then subtracted from a similar image taken in 1986 (right panel), highlighting the relative expansion.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/sn1006_noao_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"SN 1006: History's Brightest Supernova","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/sn1006_noao.jpg"},{"date":"2003-03-18","explanation":"The ominous, dark shapes haunting the left side of the Sun are coronal holes -- low density regions extending above the surface where the solar magnetic field opens freely into interplanetary space. Studied extensively from space since the 1960s in ultraviolet and x-ray light, coronal holes are known to be the source of the high-speed solar wind, atoms and electrons which flow outward along the open magnetic field lines. During periods of low activity, coronal holes typically cover regions just above the Sun's poles. These coronal holes, however, have just moved into view near the Sun's equator, and particles escaping them have already caused notable aurora here on Earth. Coronal holes like this one may last for a few solar rotations before the magnetic fields shift and change configurations. Shown in false-color, this picture of the Sun on March 9 was made in extreme ultraviolet light by the EIT instrument on board the space-based SOHO observatory.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/holes_soho_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Coronal Holes on the Sun","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/holes_soho.jpg"},{"date":"2003-03-19","explanation":"Seventeenth century astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini was an astute observer of Jupiter's Great Red Spot. So it seems only fitting that his namesake, the Cassini spacecraft, has enabled detailed observations of another planet-sized blemish -- Jupiter's Great Dark Spot. Unlike the Red Spot, the Great Dark Spot lies near Jupiter's north pole and seems to appear and disappear over periods of months rather than persisting for hundreds of years. Seen at ultraviolet wavelengths, the dark feature resides in the Jovian stratosphere confined by pole-encircling winds, analogous to planet Earth's antarctic ozone hole. This image of the Dark Spot is a single frame from a movie created with data recorded during the spacecraft's year 2000 flyby of Jupiter. Projected to show Jupiter's north polar region, no data are available for the blank central area, while the Great Dark Spot lies above and just left of center. The white circle marks 60 degrees latitude and the blue contour outlines a persistent Jovian auroral zone which may be related to the formation of the Great Dark Spot.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/jupspot_cassini_frame58.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Jupiter's Great Dark Spot","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/jupspot_cassini_c1.jpg"},{"copyright":"Anthony Ayiomamitis","date":"2003-03-20","explanation":"Astronomically speaking, at the Equinox on March 21, 0100 UT (March 20, 8:00 PM ET) the season changes. For this Equinox the Sun rises due east as it crosses the celestial equator heading north. In celebration, consider this spectacular sunrise analemma! An analemma is the figure-8 loop you get when you mark the position of the Sun at the same time each day throughout the year. In this remarkable case, 38 separate exposures (and 1 foreground exposure) were recorded on a single piece of film between January 12 and December 21, 2002 at 0600 UT.  The tilt of planet Earth's axis and the variation in speed as it moves around its elliptical orbit combine to produce the predictable analemma curve. The top and bottom of the figure-8 correspond to the Solstices -- the Northern and Southern limits of the Sun's sky motion. The two Equinoxes find the Sun at points along the anelemma curve exactly half way between the Solstices. Here, the analemma's Southern portion is partly hidden by mountains.

Planet Jupiter and stars Procyon, Castor, and Pollux also appear within the circle of lunar light. Castor and Pollux, twins in Greek Mythology, are appropriately bright stars of the constellation Gemini while Procyon is the brightest star in Canis Minor. The circular halo is produced by six-sided ice crystals in thin high-altitude clouds, which refract the moonlight and give the halo a characteristic radius of 22 degrees.

This planetary nebula's simple, graceful appearance is thought to be due to perspective -- our view from planet Earth looking straight into what is actually a barrel-shaped cloud of gas shrugged off by a dying central star. Astronomers of the Hubble Heritage Project produced this strikingly sharp image from Hubble Space Telescope observations using natural appearing colors to indicate the temperature of the stellar gas shroud. Hot blue gas near the energizing central star gives way to progressively cooler green and yellow gas at greater distances with the coolest red gas along the outer boundary. Dark, elongated structures can also be seen near the nebula's edge.

In the above picture, the brightness of the stars overwhelm the photograph causing an illusion of great size, even though the stars are really just small points of light.  The Alpha Centauri system is not visible in much of the northern hemisphere.  Alpha Centauri A, also known as Rigil Kentaurus, is the brightest star in the constellation of Centaurus and is the fourth brightest star in the night sky.

Mars, the red planet named for the Roman god of war, has two tiny moons, Phobos and Deimos, whose names are derived from the Greek for Fear and Panic.

Therefore, sometimes it flies over them, but also sometimes it flies right through.  The auroral electron and proton streams are too thin to be a danger to the ISS, just as clouds pose little danger to airplanes.  ISS Science Officer Don Pettit captured a green aurora, pictured above in a digitally sharpened image.

Like a baby chick pecking its way out of an egg, the star in the center of the Egg Nebula is casting away shells of gas and dust as it slowly transforms itself into a white dwarf star.  The Egg Nebula is a rapidly evolving pre-planetary nebula spanning about one light year toward the constellation of Cygnus. Thick dust, though, blocks the center star from view, while the dust shells further out reflect light from this star.  Light vibrating in the plane defined by each dust grain, the central star, and the observer is preferentially reflected, causing an effect known as polarization.  Measuring the orientation of the polarized light for the Egg Nebula gives clues to location of the hidden source.  The above image taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope is false-color coded to highlight the orientation of polarization.

Looking like an emerging space cocoon, the Crescent Nebula, visible on the right, was created by the brightest star in its center.  A leading progenitor hypothesis has the Crescent Nebula beginning to form about 250,000 years ago.  At that time, the massive central star had evolved to become a Wolf-Rayet star (WR 136), shedding its outer envelope in a strong stellar wind, ejecting the equivalent of our Sun's mass every 10,000 years.  This wind impacted surrounding gas left over from a previous phase, compacting it into a series of complex shells, and lighting it up.

As a plane accelerates to just break the sound barrier, however, an unusual cloud might form.  The origin of this cloud is still debated.  A leading theory is that a drop in air pressure at the plane described by the Prandtl-Glauert Singularity occurs so that moist air condenses there to form water droplets.  Above, an F/A-18 Hornet was  photographed just as it broke the sound barrier.  Large meteors and the space shuttle frequently produce audible sonic booms before they are slowed below sound speed by the Earth's atmosphere.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0102/sonicboomplane_navy_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Sonic Boom","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0102/sonicboomplane_navy.jpg"},{"date":"2003-05-05","explanation":"In NGC 1275, one galaxy is slicing through another.

With less than this critical mass they evolve into red giants, pass through a relatively peaceful planetary nebula phase, and calmly fade away as white dwarf stars like this one. Except that as a member of the NGC 1818 cluster, this new white dwarf would have evolved from a red giant star over 7.6 times as massive as the sun -- which should have exploded! Its discovery will likely force astronomers to revise the limiting mass estimate for supernovae upward.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0305/ngc1818_hst_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 1818: Pick A Star","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0305/ngc1818_hst_c1.jpg"},{"date":"2003-06-01","explanation":"In the center of a swirling whirlpool of hot gas is likely a beast that has never been seen directly: a black hole.  Studies of the bright light emitted by the swirling gas frequently indicate not only that a black hole is present, but also likely attributes.  The gas surrounding GRO J1655-40, for example, has been found to display an unusual flickering at a rate of 450 times a second.  Given a previous mass estimate for the central object of seven times the mass of our Sun, the rate of the fast flickering can be explained by a black hole that is rotating very rapidly.  What physical mechanisms actually cause the flickering -- and a slower quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) -- in  accretion disks surrounding black holes and neutron stars remains a topic of much research.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0306/blackholestorm_chandra_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"GRO J1655-40: Evidence for a Spinning Black Hole","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0306/blackholestorm_chandra.jpg"},{"date":"2003-06-02","explanation":"Fogs of clouds and dust covered parts of southern Mars during last Martian winter.  Giant volcanoes, such as Ascraeus Mons, the central circular feature near the top of the image, were surrounded by large water clouds.  Slightly southwest, Pavonis Mons and Arisa Mons also peeked above their water clouds.  The rough terrain below center is Labyrinthus Noctis, a maze of deep troughs running over 200 kilometers long.   Directly south, a large white dust storm fogs Syria Planum, a large plateau.  This image mosaic was taken by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft currently orbiting Mars.

Each month, our Moon passes in front of -- and outshines -- many an interesting star field.  Exceptions occur during a new Moon and during a total eclipse.  In the background of a new Moon is usually the Sun, an even brighter orb that even more easily outshines everything behind it, except during a total solar eclipse.  Even the longest total solar eclipse lasts just a few minutes, while the Sun's corona still remains bright.  During a total lunar eclipse, however, the full Moon dims and a majestic star field may present itself for an hour or more.  Such was the case during the middle of last month, when a rare glimpse of an eclipsed Moon superposed in front of the disk of our home Milky Way Galaxy was captured.  Although fully in the Earth's shadow, the eclipsed Moon is still the brightest object on the right.  The above image was captured during sub-zero weather from the Teide 2003 expedition to Mirador del Pico Viejo, a mountain in the Canary Islands, Spain, off the northwest coast of Africa.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0306/milkymoon_casado_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Milky Way Behind an Eclipsed Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0306/milkymoon_casado.jpg"},{"copyright":"Olivier\nMeeckersGroupe Astronomie\nde Spa","date":"2003-06-04","explanation":"The Sun and Moon rose together over much of Europe on the morning of May 31st with the first solar eclipse of 2003 already in progress. And while sightings of the full annular phase of the eclipse were restricted to far northern regions, early morning risers were still treated to inspiring views of two celestial bodies which are most important to life on planet Earth. Following the dawn's spectacle from Charneux, Belgium, astrophotographer Olivier Meeckers recorded this evocative image of the partially eclipsed Sun rising above a primeval apparition of mists and trees. Last month was indeed a rewarding one for eclipse watchers as May's full Moon and (second) new Moon lined up for their respective lunar and solar eclipses. November 2003 will also host both a total lunar and total solar eclipse.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0306/EclipseSoleil1_meeckers_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Eclipse in the Mist","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0306/EclipseSoleil1_meeckers_c1.jpg"},{"copyright":"Hans Coeckelberghs","date":"2003-06-05","explanation":"If the Moon's apparent diameter is not quite large enough to cover the Sun during a solar eclipse, an annular eclipse can be the result -- a spectacle of silhouetted Moon surrounded by a solar \"ring of fire\". Just such a view was possible for observers in the far northern hemisphere as the new Moon slid across the solar disk on May 31st. Still, for astronomical adventurers at Cape Wrath on the northwestern coast of Scotland, the eastern sky was cloudy on eclipse day. But fortunately the Sun became visible a few minutes prior to the annular phase and determined astronomer Hans Coeckelberghs was able to capture this dramatic telescopic image of the eclipsed Sun's ring of fire looming through a reddened, cloud-streaked sky. Not to be outdone by the north, the far southern hemisphere will host the next solar eclipse, with the path of totality racing across Antarctica on November 23rd.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0306/Eclips310503_coeckelberghs_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Ring of Fire from Cape Wrath","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0306/Eclips310503_coeckelberghs_c1.jpg"},{"copyright":"Thilo Kranz","date":"2003-06-06","explanation":"Anticipating the celestial shadow play of a solar eclipse, sky gazers across Germany watched the Sun rise on May 31. In Bonn, astrophotographer Thilo Kranz had set up his small refractor telescope and camera on the Kennedy Bridge across the Rhein river to get a good view to the northeast. The timing of this eclipse must have seemed ideal for a local balloon flight too, as hot air balloonists also favor early morning hours with usually calm surface winds. Kranz and colleagues had noticed a balloon drifting in the hazy sky near the horizon and speculated about viewing the eclipse from on board. But when the eclipsed Sun finally emerged into view they were delighted to see the lighter-than-air craft make the occasion a very special show from their own vantage point. In fact, in the central panel of this montage of Kranz's telescopic eclipse images, the silhouetted balloon reminds the APOD editors of a remarkably well-fed exclamation mark!","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0306/SoFiMontage2_kranz.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Sun, Moon, Hot Air Balloon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0306/sunmoonballoon2_kranz.jpg"},{"date":"2003-06-07","explanation":"How did spiral galaxy ESO 510-13 get bent out of shape? The disks of many spirals are thin and flat, but not solid. Spiral disks are loose conglomerations of billions of stars and diffuse gas all gravitationally orbiting a galaxy center. A flat disk is thought to be created by sticky collisions of large gas clouds early in the galaxy's formation.  Warped disks are not uncommon, though, and even our own Milky Way Galaxy is thought to have a small warp.  The causes of spiral warps are still being investigated, but some warps are thought to result from interactions or even collisions between galaxies.  ESO 510-13 is about 150 million light years away and about 100,000 light years across.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0306/eso510_hst_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Warped Spiral Galaxy ESO 510-13","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0306/eso510_hst_c1.jpg"}]
