Pluto recent reclassification, by the International Astronomical Union, from planet to dwarf planet remains a topic of much debate. The above map was created by tracking brightness changes from Earth of Pluto during times when it was being partially eclipsed by its moon Charon.  The map therefore shows the hemisphere of Pluto that faces Charon.  Pluto's brown color is thought dominated by frozen methane deposits metamorphosed by faint but energetic sunlight.

To help find out, a team of researchers took the most detailed image ever of gas clouds and dust in the neighboring Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxy.  The composite image, shown above, was taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope in infrared light, which highlights the natural glow of the warm materials returned to the interstellar medium by stars. The above mosaic combines 300,000 individual pointings to create a composite 1,000-times sharper than any previous LMC image. Visible are vast clouds of gas and dust, showing in graphic detail that dust prefers regions near young stars (red-tinted bright clouds), scattered unevenly between the stars (green-tinted clouds), and in shells around old stars (small red dots).  Also visible are huge caverns cleared away by the energetic outflows of massive former stars. The faint blue (false-color) glow across the bottom is the combined light from the old stars in the central bar of the LMC.   The LMC is a satellite galaxy to our own Milky Way Galaxy, spans about 70,000 light years, and lies about 160,000 light years away toward the southern constellation of the Swordfish (Dorado).","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0609/lmc_spitzer_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Large Magellanic Cloud in Infrared","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0609/lmc_spitzer.jpg"},{"date":"2006-09-05","explanation":"What causes the bright streaks on Dione?  Recent images of this unusual moon by the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn are helping to crack the mystery.  Close inspection of Dione's trailing hemisphere, pictured above, indicates that the white wisps are composed of deep ice cliffs dropping hundreds of meters. The cliffs may indicate that Dione has undergone some sort of tectonic surface displacements in its past. The bright ice-cliffs run across some of Dione's many craters, indicating that the process that created them occurred later than the impacts that created those craters.  Dione is made of mostly water ice but its relatively high density indicates that it contains much rock inside.  Giovanni Cassini discovered Dione in 1684.  The above image was taken at the end of July from a distance of about 263,000 kilometers.

Historically of great interest to astronomers, M33's giant HII regions are some of the largest known stellar nurseries - sites of the formation of short-lived but very massive stars. Intense ultraviolet radiation from the luminous, massive stars ionizes the surrounding hydrogen gas and ultimately produces the characteristic red glow. A prominent member of the local group of galaxies, M33 is also known as the Triangulum Galaxy and lies about 3 million light-years distant.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0611/m33hargb_schur_F1024.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Hydrogen in M33","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0611/m33hargb_schur_F717.jpg"},{"copyright":"Galaxy Images","date":"2006-11-24","explanation":"Runaway stars are massive stars traveling rapidly through interstellar space. Like a ship plowing through cosmic seas, runaway star Alpha Cam has produced this graceful arcing bow wave or bow shock - moving at over 60 kilometers per second and compressing the interstellar material in its path. The bright star above and left of center in this wide (3x2 degree) view, Alpha Cam is about 25-30 times as massive as the Sun, 5 times hotter (30,000 kelvins), and over 500,000 times brighter. About 4,000 light-years away in the long-necked constellation Camelopardalis, the star also produces a strong wind. The bow shock stands off about 10 light-years from the star itself. What set this star in motion? Astronomers have long thought that Alpha Cam was flung out of a nearby cluster of young hot stars due to gravitational interactions with other cluster members or perhaps by the supernova explosion of a massive companion star.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0611/AlphaCam_mandel_f.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Alpha Cam: Runaway Star","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0611/AlphaCam_mandel_f717.jpg"},{"copyright":"Greg Piepol","date":"2006-11-25","explanation":"Mercury is now visible shortly before dawn, the brightest \"star\" just above the eastern horizon.

Our Galaxy is thought to look much like Andromeda.  Together these two galaxies dominate the Local Group of galaxies.  The diffuse light from Andromeda is caused by the hundreds of billions of stars that compose it.  The several distinct stars that surround Andromeda's image are actually stars in our Galaxy that are well in front of the background object.  Andromeda is frequently referred to as M31 since it is the 31st object on  Messier's list of diffuse sky objects.  M31 is so distant it takes about two million years for light to reach us from there.  Although visible without aid, the above image of M31 is a digital mosaic of 20 frames taken with a small telescope.  Much about M31 remains unknown, including how the center acquired two nuclei.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0611/andromeda_gendler_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"M31: The Andromeda Galaxy","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0611/andromeda_gendler.jpg"},{"date":"2006-11-27","explanation":"What causes the mysterious spokes in Saturn's rings?  Visible on the left of the above image as ghostlike impressions, spokes were first discovered by the Voyager spacecraft that buzzed by Saturn in the early 1980s.  Their existence was unexpected, and no genesis hypothesis has ever become accepted.  Oddly, the spokes were conspicuously absent from initial images sent back by the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn.  Analyses of archived Voyager images have led to the conclusions that the transient spokes, which may form and dissipate over a few hours, are composed of electrically charged sheets of small dust-sized particles. Some recent images from Cassini like that shown above have now finally shown the enigmatic spokes superposed on Saturn's B ring.   Hypotheses for spoke creation include small meteors impacting the rings and electron beams from Saturnian atmospheric lightning spraying the rings.  Observations of the puzzling spokes, as well as creative origin speculations, are ongoing.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0611/spokes_cassini_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Mysterious Spokes in Saturn's Rings \n","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0611/spokes_cassini.jpg"},{"date":"2006-11-28","explanation":"Why is this galaxy so discombobulated?  Usually, galaxies this topsy-turvy result from a recent collision with a neighboring galaxy. Spiral galaxy NGC 1313, however, appears to be alone.  Brightly lit with new and blue massive stars, star formation appears so rampant in NGC 1313 that it has been labeled a starburst galaxy.  Strange features of NGC 1313 include that its spiral arms are lopsided and its rotational axis is not at the center of the nuclear bar.  Pictured above, NGC 1313 spans about 50,000 light years and lies only about 15 million light years away toward the constellation of Reticulum.

The Pelican and North America nebulae are part of the same large and complex star forming region, almost as nearby as the better-known Orion Nebula. From our vantage point, dark dust clouds (upper left) help define the Pelican's eye and long bill, while a bright front of ionized gas suggests the curved shape of the head and neck.
