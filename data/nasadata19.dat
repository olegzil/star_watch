Perhaps 20 kilometers across but with more mass than the Sun, this ultracompact object is the collapsed core of a massive star. The core collapsed when the star, located a reassuring 5,000 light-years away in the constellation Gemini, exploded long ago. How long ago? Judging from the characteristic bow wave shape of the x-ray nebula the researchers have estimated the speed of the neutron star as it plows away from the explosion site.

The expended gas frequently forms an impressive display called a planetary nebula that fades gradually over thousand of years.

In the above recently released photograph by the Hubble Space Telescope taken in ultraviolet light, the aurorae appear as annular sheets around the pole.  Unlike Earth's aurorae, Jupiter's aurorae include several bright streaks and dots.  These marks are caused by magnetic flux tubes connecting Jupiter to its largest moons.

A: Because they have an event horizon. The event horizon is that one-way boundary predicted by general relativity beyond which nothing, not even light, can return. X-ray astronomers using the space-based Chandra Observatory now believe they have direct evidence for event horizons - therefore black holes - in binary star systems which can be detected in x-ray light. These binaries, sometimes called x-ray novae, are known to consist of relatively normal stars dumping material on to massive, compact companions. As illustrated, the material swirls toward the companion in an accretion disk which itself glows in x-rays. If the compact companion is a neutron star (right), the material ultimately smashes into the solid surface and glows even more brightly in high energy x-rays. But if it is indeed a black hole with a defining event horizon, then the x-ray hot material approaches the speed of light as it swirls past the surface of no return and is lost from view. Recent work describes observations of two classes of x-ray binaries, one class 100 times fainter than the other. The results imply the presence of an event horizon in the fainter class which causes the extreme difference in x-ray brightness.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0101/blackhole_illustration.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Black Holes Are Black","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0101/blackhole_illustration.jpg"},{"date":"2001-01-20","explanation":"This image of the active Sun was made using ultraviolet light emitted by ionized Helium atoms in the Solar chromosphere.

Planetary nebula Mz3 is being cast off by a star similar to our Sun that is, surely, round.  Why then would the gas that is streaming away create an ant-shaped nebula that is distinctly not round?  Clues might include the high 1000-kilometer per second speed of the expelled gas, the light-year long length of the structure, and the magnetism of the star visible above at the nebula's center.  One possible answer is that Mz3 is hiding a second, dimmer star that orbits close in to the bright star.  A competing hypothesis holds that the central star's own spin and magnetic field are channeling the gas.  Since the central star appears to be so similar to our own Sun, astronomers hope that increased understanding of the history of this giant space ant can provide useful insight into the likely future of our own Sun and Earth.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0102/mz3_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Planetary Nebula Mz3: The Ant Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0102/mz3_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2001-02-06","explanation":"The first controlled descent of a spacecraft onto an asteroid is scheduled to occur next week.

But, as the asteroid orbits, the spacecraft's solar panels will be repeatedly turned toward the Sun ... offering the possibility of reawakening this survivor.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0103/xgrsplot_near_c1.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Survivor: NEAR Shoemaker On Asteroid Eros","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0103/xgrsplot_near_c2.jpg"},{"copyright":"Michael Pierce","date":"2001-03-06","explanation":"The first hint of what will become of our Sun was discovered inadvertently in 1764.  At that time, Charles Messier was compiling a list of \"annoying\" diffuse objects not to be confused with \"interesting\" comets.  The 27th object on Messier's list, now known as M27 or the Dumbbell Nebula, is a planetary nebula, the type of nebula our Sun will produce when nuclear fusion stops in its core.  M27 is one of the brightest planetary nebulae on the sky, and can be seen in the constellation Vulpecula with binoculars.  It takes light about 1000 years to reach us from M27,  shown above in representative colors.  Understanding the physics and significance of M27 was well beyond 18th century science.  Even today, many things remain mysterious about bipolar planetary nebula like M27, including the physical mechanism that expels a low-mass star's gaseous outer-envelope, leaving an X-ray hot white dwarf.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0103/dumbbell_noao_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"M27: The Dumbbell Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0103/dumbbell_noao.jpg"},{"date":"2001-03-07","explanation":"From a spectacular vantage point over 1.4 billion kilometers from the sun, the Voyager 1 spacecraft looked back toward the inner solar system to record this startling view of Saturn's nightside. The picture was taken on November 16, 1980, some four days after the robot spacecraft's closest approach to the gorgeous gas giant. The crescent planet casts a broad shadow across its bright rings while the translucent rings themselves can be seen to cast a shadow on Saturn's cloud tops. Since Earth is closer to the sun than Saturn, only Saturn's dayside is visible to Earth-bound telescopes which could never take a picture like this one. After this successful flyby two decades ago, Voyager 1 has continued outward bound and is presently humanity's most distant spacecraft. The next spacecraft to approach Saturn will be Cassini, on course to arrive in 2004.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0103/nightsaturn_voyager1_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Saturn At Night","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0103/nightsaturn_voyager1.jpg"},{"copyright":"Thad K.

With only a few member galaxies per group, HCGs are much smaller than the immense clusters of galaxies which lurk in the cosmos, but like the large galaxy clusters, some HCGs seem to be filled with hot, x-ray emitting gas. In fact, groups of galaxies like HCGs may be the building blocks of the large clusters. This false-color x-ray image from the orbiting Chandra Observatory reveals x-ray emission from the gas in one such group, HCG 62, in startling detail. In the image, black and green colors represent low intensities while red and purple hues indicate high x-ray intensities. Striking features of the x-ray image are the low brightness blobs at the upper left and lower right which symmetrically flank the intense central x-ray region. HCG 62 lies in Virgo, and near the group's center resides elliptical galaxy NGC 4761. At optical wavelengths, some HCGs make for rewarding viewing, even with modest sized telescopes.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0103/hcg62_cxc_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"X-Rays From HCG 62","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0103/hcg62_cxc.jpg"},{"date":"2001-03-10","explanation":"Put on your red/blue glasses and gaze into this dramatic stereo view from the surface of the Moon! Inspired by last Saturday's APOD, experimentor Patrick Vantuyne offers this stereo rendering of Apollo 12 astronaut Pete Conrad visiting the Surveyor 3 spacecraft in November of 1969. To create the stereo image, Vantuyne carefully combed through the pictures available for downloading from the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal web site to find two which would make an appropriate \"stereo pair\". He found a pair that depicted the captivating scene from only slightly different viewpoints, approximating the separation between human eyes. Combining the two separate pictures, one tinted red and the other blue-green, with the correct offset, produces the stereo effect when viewed using red/blue glasses, the red filter covering the left eye. The color filters guide each eye to see only the picture with the correct corresponding viewpoint and the brain interprets the result as normal stereo vision. (Editor's note: While you've got those glasses on ... other web sources of astronomy and space science stereo images include the Mars Path Finder archive and a 3D Tour of the Solar System.)","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0103/ana01_vantuyne.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Apollo / Surveyor Stereo View","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0103/ana01_vantuyne.jpg"}]
