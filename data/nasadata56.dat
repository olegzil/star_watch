The same principle that keeps neutron stars and white dwarf stars from imploding also keeps people from imploding and makes normal matter mostly empty space. The observed reason is known as the Pauli Exclusion Principle.  The principle states that identical fermions -- one type of fundamental matter -- cannot be in the same place at the same time and with the same orientation.  The other type of matter, bosons, do not have this property, as demonstrated clearly by recently created Bose-Einstein condensates.  Earlier this decade, the Pauli Exclusion Principle was demonstrated graphically in the above picture of clouds of two isotopes of lithium -- the left cloud composed of bosons while the right cloud is composed of fermions.  As temperature drops, the bosons bunch together, while the fermions better keep their distance.  The reason why the Pauli Exclusion Principle is true and the physical limits of the principle are still unknown.   digg_url = 'http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100228.html'; digg_skin = 'compact';","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1002/fermiexclusion_hulet_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Pauli Exclusion Principle: Why You Don't Implode","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1002/fermiexclusion_hulet.jpg"},{"date":"2010-03-01","explanation":"What creates these picturesque dark streaks on Mars?

The sand appears to flow like a liquid around boulders, and, for some reason, lightens significantly over time. This sand flow process is one of several which can rapidly change the surface of Mars, with other processes including dust devils, dust storms, and the freezing and melting of areas of ice.

But elliptical galaxies seem to be simpler. Lacking gas and dust to form new stars, their randomly swarming older stars, give them an ellipsoidal (egg-like) shape. Still, elliptical galaxies can be very large. Centered in this telescopic view and over 120,000 light-years in diameter, larger than our own Milky Way, elliptical galaxy M87 (NGC 4486) is the dominant galaxy of the Virgo Galaxy Cluster. Some 50 million light-years away, M87 is likely home to a supermassive black hole responsible for a high-energy jet of particles emerging from the giant galaxy's central region. In this well-processed image, M87's jet is near the one o'clock position. Other galaxies are also in the field of view, including large Virgo Cluster ellipticals NGC 4478 right of center and NGC 4476 near the right edge.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/m87jet_block.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"M87: Elliptical Galaxy with Jet","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/m87jet_block900.jpg"},{"copyright":"Clear Skies","date":"2010-05-21","explanation":"Last weekend, the Moon and Venus formed a beautiful close pair in the west after sunset, a scene enjoyed by skygazers all over the world. In this lovely view of the conjunction from Sweden, a calm lake Vallentuna lies in the foreground with sunset colors still fading behind the treeline on the far shore. The young Moon's sunlit crescent is bright, but its entire outline can be seen by Earthshine, light reflected from planet Earth itself. For well-placed skygazers, on Sunday, May 16 the Moon actually occulted (passed in front of) brilliant Venus.

The ominous structure appears to be frozen in time near the Sun's edge, but solar filaments are unstable and often erupt. The detailed scene was captured on May 18 in extreme ultraviolet light by cameras on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. While the cooler plasma of the filament looks dark, hotter, brighter plasma below traces magnetic field lines emerging from the active region. When seen arcing above the edge of the Sun, filaments actually look bright against the dark background of space and are called prominences.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/SDO_filament_May2010.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Dark Filament of the Sun","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/SDO_filament_May2010_900.jpg"},{"copyright":"Thierry Legault","date":"2010-05-23","explanation":"That's no sunspot.  On the upper right of the above image of the Sun, the dark patches are actually the International Space Station (ISS) and the Space Shuttle Atlantis on mission STS-132.  In the past, many skygazers have spotted the space station and space shuttles as bright stars gliding through twilight skies, still glinting in the sunlight while orbiting about 350 kilometers above the Earth's surface. But here, astrophotographer Thierry Lagault accurately computed the occurrence of a rarer opportunity to record the spacefaring combination moving quickly in silhouette across the solar disk. He snapped the above picture on last Sunday on May 16, about 50 minutes before the shuttle docked with the space station.

Rho Ophiuchi itself is a binary star system visible in the light-colored region on the image right. The star system, located only 400 light years away, is distinguished by its colorful surroundings, which include a red emission nebula and numerous light and dark brown dust lanes. Near the upper right of the Rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud system is the yellow star Antares, while a distant but coincidently-superposed globular cluster of stars, M4, is visible between Antares and the red emission nebula. Near the image bottom lies IC 4592, the Blue Horsehead nebula.  The blue glow that surrounds the Blue Horsehead's eye -- and other stars around the image -- is a reflection nebula composed of fine dust. On the above image left is a geometrically angled reflection nebula cataloged as Sharpless 1.  Here, the bright star near the dust vortex creates the light of surrounding reflection nebula. Although most of these features are visible through a small telescope pointed toward the constellations of Ophiuchus, Scorpius, and Sagittarius, the only way to see the intricate details of the dust swirls, as featured above, is to use a long exposure camera.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/rhoregion_andreo_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Rho Ophiuchi Wide Field","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/rhoregion_andreo.jpg"},{"date":"2010-05-25","explanation":"It's been a long trip for the Martian rover Opportunity.

Quite a bit, from the looks of the above one-night, time-lapse movie, taken earlier this month. The majestic volcano is first seen through breaks in fast moving clouds as the movie begins. Soon the clouds have dissipated and a sky filled with stars seems to rotate about the snow-peaked volcano's peak.  The band of our Milky Way Galaxy, the dark Coal Sack nebula, and the Southern Cross can all be seen overhead. Satellites streak by from several directions. Soon thin clouds roll by and seem to make the brightest stars sparkle. On the volcano (starting at about 1:13 of the movie), the lights of climbers flash.

Telescopic views reveal the spectacular cluster's hundreds of thousands of stars. At a distance of 25,000 light-years, the cluster stars crowd into a region 150 light-years in diameter, but approaching the cluster core upwards of 100 stars could be contained in a cube just 3 light-years on a side. For comparison, the closest star to the Sun is over 4 light-years away. Along with the cluster's dense core, the outer reaches of M13 are highlighted in this sharp color image.

It shows star trails too, including the very bright trail of planet Venus setting, below the Moon, near the right edge of the frame. Arcing from the horizon on the right to the picture's left edge is a surprisingly colorful trail produced by space shuttle orbiter Atlantis docked with the International Space Station. Some 350 kilometers above Earth's surface, the orbiter and station pair are still bathed in sunlight. Though it might seem more appropriate when seen in skies over Rhodes, the shuttle orbiter Atlantis wasn't directly named for the legendary island of Atlantis. Instead, it was named for 1930s vintage sailing ship RV Atlantis, the first research vessel operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/iss_100517_ladanyi.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Atlantis over Rhodes","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/iss_100517_ladanyi900.jpg"},{"date":"2010-05-29","explanation":"Violent galaxy mergers can feed supermassive black holes. Theoretically, the result is intense emission from regions near the supermassive black holes, creating the some of the most luminous objects in the universe. Astronomers dub these Active Galactic Nuclei, or just AGN. But for decades only about 1 percent of AGN seemed to be associated with galaxy mergers. New results from a premier sky survey by NASA's Swift satellite at hard (energetic) X-ray energies now solidly show a strong association of AGN with merging galaxies, though. The hard X-rays more readily penetrate dust and gas clouds in merging galaxies and reveal the presence of emission from the active black holes. In fact, these panels show the location (circled) of Swift X-ray detected supermassive black holes in a variety of merging galaxy systems. The optical images are from the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona. At top center is NGC 7319 and the compact galaxy group known as Stephan's Quintet.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/Swift_AGN_galaxies_labels.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Black Holes in Merging Galaxies","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1005/Swift_AGN_galaxies_labels900.jpg"}]
