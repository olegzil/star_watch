[{"date":"2008-11-30","explanation":"What would it be like to explore the Moon? NASA's Apollo missions gave humans just this chance in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  In particular, the Apollo 15 mission was dedicated to better understanding the surface of the Moon by exploring mountains, valleys, maria, and highlands. Astronauts David Scott and James Irwin spent nearly three days on the Moon while Alfred Worden orbited above in the Command Module.  The mission, which blasted off from Earth on 1971 July 26, was the first to deploy a Lunar Roving Vehicle.  Pictured above in this digitally stitched mosaic panorama, David Scott examines a boulder in front of the summit of Mt. Hadley Delta.  The shadow of James Irwin is visible to the right, while scrolling to the right will reveal a well-lit and diverse lunar terrain.  The Apollo 15 mission returned about 76 kilograms of moon rocks for detailed study.  In the future, NASA and other space agencies plan to continue to lead humanity's exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond.   digg_url = 'http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap081130.html'; digg_skin = 'compact';","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0811/hillpan_apollo15_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"An Apollo 15 Panorama: Astronaut Exploring","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0811/hillpan_apollo15.jpg"},{"date":"2008-12-01","explanation":"How massive can stars be? Big, hefty stars live short violent lives that can profoundly affect their environments.  Isolating a massive star can be problematic, however, since what seems to be a single bright star might actually turn out to be several stars close together. Such was the case for two of the brightest objects visible in the open star cluster Trumpler 16, located in the southern Carina Nebula. Upon close inspection by the Hubble Space Telescope, WR 25, the brightest object in the above image, was confirmed to consist of at least two separate stars.  Additionally, Tr16 -244, just to the upper right of WR 25, was resolved for the first time to be at least three individual stars.  Even so, the brightest star in WR 25 appears to be about 50 times the mass of our Sun, making it one of the more massive stars known. Winds from these stars are likely significant contributers to the large bubble that the star cluster sits in. The Carina Nebula, home to unusually shaped dust clouds and the famous variable star Eta Carina, lies about 7,500 light years away toward the constellation of Ship's Keel (Carina).   digg_url = 'http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap081201.html'; digg_skin = 'compact';","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0812/trumpler16b_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Massive Stars Resolved in the Carina Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0812/trumpler16b_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2008-12-02","explanation":"Where's the astronaut?

Once a controversial claim, this conclusion is now solidly based on 16 years of observations that map the orbits of 28 stars very near the galactic center. Using European Southern Observatory telescopes and sophisticated near infrared cameras, astronomers patiently measured the positions of the stars over time, following one star, designated S2, through a complete orbit as it came within about 1 light-day of the center of the Milky Way. Their results convincingly show that S2 is moving under the influence of the enormous gravity of a compact, unseen object -- a black hole with 4 million times the mass of the Sun. Their ability to track stars so close to the galactic center accurately measures the black hole's mass and also determines the distance to the center to be 27,000 light-years.

The pulsar's energy accelerates charged particles, producing eerie, glowing x-ray jets directed away from the poles and an intense wind in the equatorial direction. Intriguing edges are created as the charged particles stream away, eventually losing energy as they interact with the pulsar's strong magnetic field.

No one is sure.  An important confirmation that methane exists in the atmosphere of Mars occurred last week, bolstering previous controversial claims made as early as 2003.  The confirmation was made spectroscopically using large ground-based telescopes by finding precise colors absorbed on Mars that match those absorbed by methane on Earth. Given that methane is destroyed in the open martian air in a matter of years, the present existence of the fragile gas indicates that it is currently being released, somehow, from the surface of Mars. One prospect is that microbes living underground are creating it, or created it in the past.  If true, this opens the exciting possibility that life might be present under the surface of Mars even today.  Given the present data, however, it is also possible that a purely geologic process, potentially involving volcanism or rust and not involving any life forms, is the methane creator.

Several clouds are stacked up into one striking lenticular cloud.  Normally, air moves much more horizontally than it does vertically.  Sometimes, however, such as when wind comes off of a mountain or a hill, relatively strong vertical oscillations take place as the air stabilizes.  The dry air at the top of an oscillation may be quite stratified in moisture content, and hence forms  clouds at each layer where the air saturates with moisture.

It could well offer a glimpse of the future that awaits our own Sun after spending another 5 billion years or so steadily using up hydrogen at its core, and then finally helium, as fuel for nuclear fusion. Curiously, NGC 2818 seems to lie within an open star cluster, NGC 2818A, that is some 10,000 light-years distant toward the southern constellation Pyxis (the Compass). At the distance of the star cluster, the nebula would be about 4 light-years across. But accurate velocity measurements show that the nebula's own velocity is very different from the cluster's member stars. The result is strong evidence that NGC 2818 is only by chance found along the line of sight to the star cluster and so may not share the cluster's distance or age.

Although minuscule space debris may strike any satellite on occasion, the first known collision between time two full satellites occurred only last week. Even though thousands of satellites have been launched, the low collision rate is caused by the great vastness of space. Last week, however, a defunct Russian communications satellite named Cosmos 2251 smashed right into an operational US communications satellite named Iridium 33 over Siberia, Russia.  Both satellites were destroyed.  The sheer number of massive particles in a dispersing debris cloud, depicted in an inset image above, increases the risk that other operating satellites might be struck by a harmful fast-moving projectile.  The collision occurred in low Earth orbit only 750 kilometers up, a height shared by many satellites but significantly higher than the 350-km high human-occupied International Space Station.

The two interacting galaxies are separated by about 150,000 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 2442.   digg_url = 'http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap090228.html'; digg_skin = 'compact';","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0902/NGC2442pugh.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 2442: Galaxy in Volans","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0902/NGC2442pugh_c800.jpg"}]
