From their apparent densities and reflectance properties, both the rings of Saturn and its shiniest moon, Enceladus, are thought to be composed predominantly of water ice.  For reasons that are not yet understood, however, many of Saturn's ring particles have become partly coated with some sort of relatively dark dust, while the surface of Enceladus appears comparatively bright and clean.  The contrast between the two can be seen in the above image taken last month by the robot Cassini spacecraft now in orbit around Saturn.  Bright Enceladus shines in the background in contrast to the darker foreground rings.  The reason why Enceladus is so bright is currently unknown but might involve bringing fresh water to its surface with water volcanoes.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0506/ringsandmoon_cassini_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Saturn: Dirty Rings and a Clean Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0506/ringsandmoon_cassini.jpg"},{"copyright":"Panther Observatory","date":"2005-06-07","explanation":"Galaxies abound in this cosmic scene, a well chosen telescopic view toward the northern constellation of Ursa Major.

The expended gas frequently forms an impressive display called a planetary nebula that fades gradually over thousand of years.

To help find out, the robotic rover Spirit was deployed last month to park and serenely watch the Sun dip below the distant lip of Gusev crater.  It was a tough job, but some robot had to do it.  Now on Earth a red sunset is caused by two effects -- by blue light being preferentially scattered out of sunlight by oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere, and by scattering off a small amount of impurities like volcanic dust.  (The magnitude of the first effect was computed in one of Albert Einstein's most cited papers.) Although Mars lacks oxygen and nitrogen, it is covered in red dust frequently hoisted into the atmosphere by fast but thin winds.  Analyses of images like the above photograph show that at least some Martian days are capped by a sunset significantly longer and redder than typical on Earth.  For up to two hours after twilight, sunlight continued to reflect off Martian dust high in the atmosphere, casting a diffuse glow.

Looking out from within the Galaxy's disk, the true structure of the Milky Way is difficult to discern. However, the penetrating infrared census of about 30 million stars indicates that the Galaxy is distinguished by a very large central bar some 27,000 light-years long. In fact, from a vantage point that viewed our galaxy face-on, astronomers in distant galaxies would likely see a striking barred spiral galaxy suggested in this artist's illustration. While previous investigations have identified a small central barred structure, the new results indicate that the Milky Way's large bar would make about a 45 degree angle with a line joining the Sun and the Galaxy's center. DON'T PANIC ... astronomers still place the Sun beyond the central bar region, about a third of the way in from the Milky Way's outer edge.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0508/MWart_spitzer_f50.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Barred Spiral Milky Way","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0508/MWart_spitzer_c42.jpg"},{"copyright":"PhotoAstronomique.net","date":"2005-08-26","explanation":"July's Full Moon looks strangely darkened and distorted in this remarkable telescopic view. The image is one of a series recorded when the Moon was very near the horizon. The long sight-line through a turbulent atmosphere gives rise to the tantalizing optical effects, including the thin \"mirage\" shape that seems to float just above the Moon's upper edge. Also seen (more easily in the inset), along the Moon's upper edge is a noticeable green rim. Substantial atmospheric refraction produces this prism-like effect -- related to the more commonly witnessed green flash of the setting Sun. Careful inspection of the full image reveals a corresponding red rim along the lower edge, another intriguing signature of atmospheric refraction.

A surprising answer to this seemingly inconsequential question has come out of Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, USA and may not only indicate that the Standard Model of Particle Physics is incomplete but also that our universe is filled with a previously undetected type of fundamental particle.  Specifically, the muon, a particle with similarities to a heavy electron, has had its relatively large wobble under scrutiny since 1999 in an experiment known as g-2 (gee-minus-two), pictured above.  The result has galvanized other experimental groups around the world to confirm it, and pressures theorists to better understand it.  The rate of wobble is sensitive to a strange sea of virtual particles that pop into and out of existence everywhere.  The unexpected wobble rate may indicate that this sea houses virtual particles that include nearly invisible supersymmetric counterparts to known particles.  If so, a nearly invisible universe of real supersymmetric particles might exist all around us.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/g2_bowman_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Muon Wobble Possible Door to Supersymmetric Universe","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0208/g2_bowman.jpg"},{"date":"2005-08-29","explanation":"Where will Hurricane Katrina go?  One of the stronger storm systems of modern times appears headed for landfall somewhere in the southern USA sometime today.   Katrina was designated yesterday a rare Category 5 Hurricane, the strongest designation for a storm on Earth, and one that indicates sustained winds greater than 250 kilometers per hour.  Pictured above is a digitally processed image from the orbiting GOES-12 weather satellite that shows the massive storm system yesterday in the Gulf of Mexico. Starting as a slight pressure difference, hurricanes grow into large spiraling storm systems of low pressure, complete with high winds and driving rain.  A hurricane is powered by evaporating ocean water, and so typically gains strength over warm water and loses strength over land. Much remains unknown about hurricanes and cyclones, including how they are formed and the exact path they will take.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0508/katrina_goes12_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf of Mexico","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0508/katrina_goes12.jpg"},{"copyright":"Richard YandrickCosmicimage.com","date":"2005-08-30","explanation":"Sometimes, even a small telescope can help unlock a hidden beauty of the heavens.  Such is the case of the bright double star Albireo.  Seen at even slight magnification, Albireo unfolds from a bright single point into a beautiful double star of strikingly different colors.  At 380 light years distant, the two bright stars of Albireo are comparatively far from each other and take about 75,000 years to complete a single orbit.  The brighter yellow star is itself a binary star system, but too close together to be resolved even with a telescope.

Dark sky rays were caught in spectacular fashion earlier this month above Utah, USA.  The cause is something surprisingly familiar: shadows.  Clouds near the horizon can block sunlight from reflecting off air, making columns outward from the Sun appear unusually dark.  Cloud shadows can be thought of as the complement of the more commonly highlighted crepuscular rays, also visible above, where sunlight pours though cloud holes.  Sometimes, on the opposite side of the sky, anticrepuscular rays can also be seen.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0508/sunrise_nesheim_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Crepuscular Rays Over Utah","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0508/sunrise_nesheim.jpg"},{"date":"2005-09-01","explanation":"While most spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way, have two or more spiral arms, peculiar galaxy NGC 4725 has only one.

The blue color is light from NGC 4725's population of old stars.
