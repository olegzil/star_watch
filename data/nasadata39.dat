The storm appears as the white spot visible here in Saturn's southern hemisphere (south is toward the top in the picture). In particular, the storm seems to correspond with an outburst of radio noise detected by the Cassini spacecraft.

Though the new storm is larger and seems to be more powerful, it could well be the Dragon Storm reemerging.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0602/saturnstormPIA07788_cassini_f.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Saturn Storm by Ringshine","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0602/saturnstormPIA07788_cassini_c.jpg"},{"copyright":"John Chumack","date":"2006-02-24","explanation":"This pretty star field in the constellation Ophiucus is centered on a star not often seen - RS Ophiuci. In fact, early last week RS Oph suddenly became visible to the naked eye for the first time since 1985. A type of cataclysmic variable star classified as a recurrent nova, RS Oph dramatically increased in brightness from 11th magnitude, too faint to appear on some star charts. Historically, RS Oph was seen to go through only four similar outbursts since 1898. Such stars are now modeled as interacting binary star systems, composed of a compact white dwarf star co-orbiting with a swollen red giant. As material falls away from the red giant it collects in a rotating accretion disk before ultimately falling on to the white dwarf. Disk instabilities, or a build up of material on the compact star result in the occasional but rapid release of energy through nuclear burning. At an estimated distance of 3,000 light-years, RS Ophiuci is now reported to be fading rapidly. This telescopic view spans about 2 degrees (4 full moons) and was captured on the morning of February 16 from the RAS Observatory under New Mexico skies.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0602/rs_ophiuci_021606_f.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Recurrent Nova RS Ophiuci","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0602/rs_ophiuci_021606_c33.jpg"},{"date":"2006-02-25","explanation":"rlier this month, a 2.5-meter diameter infrared telescope was permanently assigned a window seat, looking through this opening in the fuselage of a historic Boeing 747 aircraft. The telescope mirror, about the size of the Hubble Space Telescope mirror, is protected by a red covering. Known as the Stratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), the airborne observatory is intended to fly at altitudes up to 45,000 feet - above more than 99% of the atmospheric water vapor. Water vapor strongly absorbs infrared light, so at that altitude SOFIA will be able to acquire infrared images not possible for even the largest ground-based telescopes. SOFIA's unique capabilities will include the ability to trace complex molecules in the cosmic environments surrounding star birth and death and the formation of new solar systems. The SOFIA aircraft was operated by Pan American World Airways and was originally christened the \"Clipper Lindbergh\". The airborne observatory was designed with an on board console for teachers and other educators to participate in research flights.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0602/sofia_backman_f.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"SOFIA's Window Seat","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0602/sofia_backman_c21.jpg"},{"copyright":"T.

A closer look at the Eagle Nebula, however, shows the bright region is actually a window into the center of a larger dark shell of dust.  Through this window, a brightly-lit workshop appears where a whole open cluster of stars is being formed.  In this cavity tall pillars and round globules of dark dust and cold molecular gas remain where stars are still forming.  Already visible are several young bright blue stars whose light and winds are burning away and pushing back the remaining filaments and walls of gas and dust.  The Eagle emission nebula, tagged M16, lies about 6500 light years away, spans about 20 light-years, and is visible with  binoculars toward the constellation of Serpens.

Something is happening in a small portion of the sky toward the constellation of Aries. Telescopes around the globe are tracking an unusual transient there as it changes day by day.  No one is sure what it will do next.  The entire space mystery began on February 18 when the Earth-orbiting robot Swift satellite noticed an unusual transient began to glow dimly in gamma rays.  Dubbed GRB 060218, the object is a type of gamma ray burst (GRB) but the way its brightness changes is very unusual.  Since detection, GRB 060218 has been found to emit light across the electromagnetic spectrum, including radio waves and visible light. Pictured above, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) image of the field of GRB 060218 well prior to its Swift trigger is shown on the left, while the same field, taken by the orbiting Swift satellites' ultraviolet telescope after the Swift trigger, is shown on the right.  The oddball GRB is visible in the center of the right image.  Subsequent observations found a redshift for the transient of z=0.033, showing it to be only about 440 million light years away, relatively nearby compared to typical GRBs.  Whether GRB 060218 represents a new type of gamma ray burst, a new type of supernova, or an unusual link between the GRBs and supernovas has become an instant topic of research.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0602/grb060218_sdssswift_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"GRB 060218: A Mysterious Transient","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0602/grb060218_sdssswift.jpg"},{"copyright":"Jean-Charles Cuillandre","date":"2006-02-28","explanation":"Rippling dust and gas lanes give the Flaming Star Nebula its name.  The red and purple colors of the nebula are present in different regions and are created by different processes.  The bright star AE Aurigae, visible toward the image left, is so hot it is blue, emitting light so energetic it knocks electrons away from surrounding gas.  When a proton recaptures an electron, red light is frequently emitted. The purple region's color is a mix of this red light and blue light emitted by AE Aurigae but reflected to us by surrounding dust. The two regions are referred to as emission nebula and reflection nebula, respectively.

If one or more of the multiverse hypotheses is correct, then quite possibly they do.  In the above computer-enhanced illustration, independent universes are shown as independent circles or spheres.  Spheres may be causally disconnected from all other spheres, meaning no communications can pass between them.  Some spheres may contain different realizations of our universe, while others may have different physical laws.  An entire set of parallel universes is called a multiverse.  The human eye might represent the possibility that realizations of some multiverse hypotheses might only exist in the human mind. One criticism of multiverse hypotheses is that they are frequently difficult to test.  Some multiverse hypotheses may therefore be great fun to think about but not practically falsifiable and therefore have no predictive scientific value.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0603/universes_pickover.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Multiverses: Do Other Universes Exist?","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0603/universes_pickover_big.jpg"},{"date":"2006-03-02","explanation":"Big, beautiful spiral galaxy M101 is one of the last entries in Charles Messier's famous catalog, but definitely not one of the least.

M101 was also one of the original spiral nebulae observed by Lord Rosse's large 19th century telescope, the Leviathan of Parsontown. Assembled from 51 exposures recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the 20th and 21st centuries, with additional data from ground based telescopes, this mosaic of M101 is touted as the largest, most detailed spiral galaxy view ever released from Hubble.

Cataloged as C/2006 A1, the comet was discovered on January 2nd by Grzegorz Pojmanski of Warsaw University Astronomical Observatory in Poland. At the time very faint and tracking through southern skies, the comet has now moved north and grown just bright enough to be a good target for early-rising skygazers with binoculars. Enhanced and framed in this picture, the comet's tail has also grown to a length of several degrees. The comet will be at its closest approach to planet Earth, just over 100 million kilometers away, on March 5.

The parallelogram lies along the active galaxy's central band of dust and stars visible in more familiar optical images. Astronomers believe that the striking geometric shape represents an approximately edge-on view of the infalling spiral galaxy's disk in the process of being twisted and warped by the interaction. Ultimately, debris from the ill-fated spiral galaxy should provide fuel for the supermassive black hole lurking at the center of Centaurus A.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0603/cena_spitzer_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Galaxy Within Centaurus A","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0603/cena_spitzer_c1.jpg"}]
