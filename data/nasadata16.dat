Supernova 1994D was not of interest for how different it was, but rather for how similar it was to other supernovae.  In fact, the light emitted during the weeks after its explosion caused it to be given the familiar designation of a Type Ia supernova.  If all Type 1a supernovae have the same intrinsic brightness, then the dimmer a supernova appears, the farther away it must be.  By calibrating a precise brightness-distance relation, astronomers are able to estimate not only the expansion rate of the universe (parameterized by the Hubble Constant), but also the geometry of the universe we live in (parameterized by Omega and Lambda).

Within 48 hours astronomers using the 2.5-meter Nordic Optical Telescope chimed in with the observation of a middle-frequency optical counterpart that was soon confirmed with the 3.5-meter Calar Alto Telescope in Spain.  By the next day the explosion was picked up in low-frequency radio waves by the by the European IRAM 30-meter dish in Spain, and then by the VLA telescopes in the US.

Major telescopes across the globe soon began playing along as GRB 000301C came into view, detailing unusual behavior.  The Hubble Space Telescope captured the above image and was the first to obtain an accurate distance to the explosion, placing it near redshift 2, most of the way across the visible universe.  The Keck II Telescope in Hawaii quickly confirmed and refined the redshift.  Still, no one is sure what type of explosion this was.

From orbit, the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft has recorded detailed images of the red planet since July 1997. Still, its cameras can not look beneath the surface. But minute changes in the spacecraft's orbital velocity are produced by variations in the planet's gravitational field, and these changes are related to interior density fluctuations. When the subtle orbital changes were measured using MGS radio science experiments and combined with the accurate Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter topographical data, researchers were able to produce a map of the thickness of the martian crust. In this color cut-away diagram of the results, red colors correspond to thin and blue to thick areas of the crust which rides above the martian mantle. From the global map, the crust is seen to range from about 20 to 50 miles thick and shows a dramatic difference between the generally thinner northern hemisphere to thicker southern hemisphere crust.

These sources are very different from the powerful gamma-ray bursters that flash and fade rapidly from view, and researchers identified some with exotic black holes, neutron stars, and distant flaring galaxies. But 170 of the cataloged sources, shown in the above all-sky map, remain unidentified. Many sources in this gamma-ray mystery map likely belong to the already known classes of gamma-ray emitters and are simply obscured or too faint to be otherwise positively identified.

The premier gamma-ray observatory far exceeded expectations for a two- to five-year mission, but a recent gyroscope failure has prompted NASA to decide to steer the satellite safely back into the atmosphere. Illustrated above, the controlled re-entry will occur early tomorrow, June 4th, in a remote area of the Pacific Ocean, approximately 2,500 miles southeast of Hawaii. The re-entry location, the largest area (about 10 million square miles) devoid of any populated land available for the observatory's re-entry, was selected to virtually eliminate the risk of human casualty. Compton's lasting legacy of discovery will include the detection of more than 400 celestial gamma-ray sources, 10 times more than were previously known; and more than 2,500 gamma-ray bursts.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/cgro_reenter_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Compton Re-entry","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/cgro_reenter.jpg"},{"date":"2000-06-04","explanation":"The sands of time are running out for the central star of this hourglass-shaped planetary nebula. With its nuclear fuel exhausted, this brief, spectacular, closing phase of a Sun-like star's life occurs as its outer layers are ejected - its core becoming a cooling, fading White Dwarf. Astronomers have recently used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to make a series of images of planetary nebulae, including the one above. Here, delicate rings of colorful glowing gas (nitrogen-red, hydrogen-green, and oxygen-blue) outline the tenuous walls of the \"hourglass\". The unprecedented sharpness of the HST images has revealed surprising details of the nebula ejection process and may help resolve the outstanding mystery of the variety of complex shapes and symmetries of planetary nebulae.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/mycn18_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"MyCn18: An Hourglass Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/mycn18_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2000-06-05","explanation":"Tomorrow's picture: Eruption on Io  < | Archive | Index | Search | Calendar | Glossary | Education | About APOD | >  Authors & editors: Robert Nemiroff (MTU) & Jerry Bonnell (USRA) NASA Technical Rep.: Jay Norris.

Hot glowing lava is visible on the left on this representative-color image.  A glowing landscape of plateaus and valleys covered in sulfur and silicate rock surrounds the active volcano.  Many features including several of the dark spots have evolved between February 2000, when the robot spacecraft Galileo currently orbiting Jupiter took this picture, and November 1999.  Io is slightly larger than Earth's Moon and is the closest large moon to Jupiter.  The above image shows a region about 250 kilometers across.

The surface of Jupiter's moon Io is home to violent volcanoes that are so active they turn the entire moon inside out.  The above photograph shows a region four kilometers across and resolves features only five meters across.  Many revealed details are not well understood.  In general, the bright areas are higher terrain than the darker areas, but some areas of the surface appear eroded by an unknown process.  Although the parts of Io's surface near erupting volcanoes are hot enough to melt rock, most of Io has cooled well below the freezing point of water.

This recent false color X-ray image of the Sun shows the active region generating the explosive events, here the Sun's most intense source of X-rays, as the dominant bright area just above center. X-ray hot plasma suspended in looping magnetic fields arcs above this region, cataloged as AR9026. AR9026 appears as a large group of sunspots in visible light images. The three intense flares were all X-class events, the most severe class of solar flares based on X-ray flux measurements by the earth-orbiting GOES satellites. Energetic particles from the CME, associated with the second X-class flare, were directed toward planet Earth and could produce geomagnetic storms as early as today. Possible effects range from increased auroral displays to disruptions of satellite and communications systems and electrical power grids. But wait ... there's more! In the coming days AR9026, carried slowly across the Sun (from left to right) by solar rotation, is likely to produce even more solar flares.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/sun00060716_sxt_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Active Regions, CMEs, and X-Class Flares","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/sun00060716_sxt.jpg"},{"date":"2000-06-09","explanation":"This stunning image from the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory is centered on the Vela pulsar -- the collapsed stellar core within the Vela supernova remnant some 800 light-years distant. The Vela pulsar is a neutron star. More massive than the Sun, it has the density of an atomic nucleus. About 12 miles in diameter it spins 10 times a second as it hurtles through the supernova debris cloud. The pulsar's electric and magnetic fields accelerate particles to nearly the speed of light, powering the compact x-ray emission nebula revealed in the Chandra picture. The cosmic crossbow shape is over 0.2 light-years across, composed of an arrow-like jet emanating from the polar region of the neutron star and bow-like inner and outer arcs believed to be the edges of tilted rings of x-ray emitting high energy particles. Impressively, the swept back compact nebula indicates the neutron star is moving up and to the right in this picture, exactly along the direction of the x-ray jet. The Vela pulsar (and associated supernova remnant) was created by a massive star which exploded over 10,000 years ago. Its awesome x-ray rings and jet are reminiscent of another well-known pulsar powered system, the Crab Nebula.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/velapulsar_cxo_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Vela Pulsar: Neutron Star-Ring-Jet","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/velapulsar_cxo.jpg"},{"date":"2000-06-10","explanation":"This picture of giant spiral galaxy Messier 101 (M101) was taken by the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT). UIT flew into orbit as part of the Astro 2 mission on-board the Space Shuttle Endeavour in March 1995. The image has been processed so that the colors (dark purple through white) represent an increasing intensity of ultraviolet light. Pictures of galaxies like this one show mainly clouds of gas containing newly formed stars many times more massive than the sun, which glow strongly in the ultraviolet. In contrast, visible light pictures of galaxies tend to be dominated by the yellow and red light of older stars. Ultraviolet light, invisible to the human eye, is blocked by ozone in the atmosphere so ultraviolet pictures of celestial objects must be taken from space. M101 is a mere 22 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. Its popular moniker is the Pinwheel Galaxy.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/m101_uit_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"M101: An Ultraviolet View","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/m101_uit.jpg"}]
