The larger the rock, though, the less often Earth is struck.  Many kilograms of space dust pitter to Earth daily. Larger bits appear initially as a bright meteor.

Significant threats do exist for rocks near 100 meters in diameter, which strike Earth roughly every 1000 years.  An object this size could cause significant tidal waves were it to strike an ocean, potentially devastating even distant shores.  A collision with a massive asteroid, over 1 km across, is more rare, occurring typically millions of years apart, but could have truly global consequences.  Many asteroids remain undiscovered.  In fact, the discovery of several was announced last week; one is shown as the long blue streak in the above photograph. Such an interplanetary collision would not affect Earth's orbit so much as raise dust that would affect Earth's climate.

Recently a new comet, designated 1998 H1, was discovered by observer Patrick L. Stonehouse of Wolverine, Michigan, USA, and announced on April 26. At 10th magnitude, comet Stonehouse is too faint to be seen by the unaided eye, but it is presently a popular object for telescope-equipped comet watchers. This false color picture of comet Stonehouse was taken on May 1st at Limber Observatory and is a composite of 8 exposures each 60 seconds long. The sequence of exposures was made with the telescope following the background stars. The individual pictures were then aligned on the comet and added together. Because of the comet's relative motion, the combined multiple-exposure shows trails of progressively offset star images but nicely captures the comet's coma and faint, tenuous tail.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9805/stoneh2_mcdavid.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Comet Stonehouse","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9805/stoneh2_mcdavid.jpg"},{"date":"1998-05-15","explanation":"This dramatic high resolution picture looking across the edge of the Sun was taken April 24th by a telescope on board the newly launched Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) satellite.

Lockyer relied on a then recently developed technique of spectroscopy, dissecting sunlight into a spectrum, and the idea that each element produces a characteristic spectral pattern of bright lines. He noticed a yellow line in a solar spectrum made during an eclipse which could not be accounted for by elements known on Earth. Almost 27 years later terrestrial Helium was finally discovered when the spectrum of a Helium bearing mineral of Uranium provided an exact match to the previously detected element of the Sun.

These discovery images were recorded by the LASCO instrument on board the space-based SOHO solar observatory on June 1-2. A portion of LASCO's circular occulting disk - which blocks the blinding direct sunlight - is seen at the upper left along with a bright solar wind region extending to the right. For scale, the size and position of the Sun's edge are outlined by the white quarter circle on the occulting disk. The Sungrazer comets approach from below and have visible tails. The lower comet's coma is bright enough to cause a horizontal blemish in the digital image, while the tail of the upper comet grows dramatically as it closes with the Sun. The pair are \"twins\" or at least \"siblings\" in the sense that they are both likely members of a family of comets thought to result from the breakup of a single large parent comet. Members of the Sungrazer family can pass within 400,000 miles or less of the solar surface and many, like this pair, do not survive.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9806/twins_soho.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"SOHO's Twin Sungrazers","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9806/twins_soho.gif"},{"date":"1998-06-12","explanation":"Few astronomical sights excite the imagination like the nearby stellar nursery known as the Orion Nebula. The Nebula's glowing gas surrounds hot young stars at the edge of an immense interstellar molecular cloud only 1,500 light-years away. This distinctively detailed image of the Orion Nebula was constructed using data from the 2 Micron All Sky Survey or 2MASS. Now underway with telescopes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres of planet Earth, the 2MASS project will map the entire sky in infrared light. The wavelength of infrared light is longer than visible light but more easily penetrates obscuring dust clouds. 2MASS cameras are sensitve to near infrared wavelengths around 2 microns or about 0.00008 inches. Visible light has a wavelength of about 0.00002 inches. Survey observations in three infrared bands were translated to blue, green, and red colors to produce this composite image.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9806/ori2mass_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Orion Nebula: The 2MASS View","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9806/ori2mass.jpg"},{"copyright":"Anglo-Australian Telescope\nBoard","date":"1998-06-13","explanation":"Stars with tens of times the mass of the Sun profoundly affect their galactic environment. Churning and mixing the interstellar gas and dust clouds they leave their mark in the compositions and locations of future generations of stars and star systems. Dramatic evidence of this is beautifully illustrated in our neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), by the lovely ring shaped nebula, Henize 70. It is actually a luminous \"superbubble\" of interstellar gas about 300 lightyears in diameter, blown by winds from massive stars and supernova explosions, its interior filled with tenuous hot expanding gas. These superbubbles offer astronomers a chance to explore this crucial connection between the lifecycles of stars and the evolution of galaxies.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9806/henize70_aat.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Henize 70: A SuperBubble In The LMC","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9806/henize70_aat.jpg"}]
