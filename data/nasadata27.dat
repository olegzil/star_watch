South is up and as the Great Red Spot tracks across the face of Jupiter, innermost Galilean moon Io enters the scene at the far right. Io occults (passes in front of) the edge of the more sedately orbiting Ganymede with Io's shadow moving quickly across the gas giant's cloud tops, just below the Red Spot. While the moon Callisto is outside the field of view, its large, dark shadow is also visible crossing the Jovian disk at the upper left. Viewed from Earth, the orbits of the Galilean moons presently lie nearly edge-on, offering many chances to observe similar dances of Jupiter's moons.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0302/JupmoonAnimation_higgins.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"When Moons and Shadows Dance","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0302/JupmoonAnimation_higgins_r10.gif"},{"copyright":"Russell Croman","date":"2003-02-28","explanation":"Glowing hydrogen gas fills this gorgeously detailed sky view centered on the variable star S Mon in the faint but fanciful constellation Monoceros, the Unicorn.

Orbiting the Sun once every 1.8 earth-years, asteroid Eros is a diminutive 40 x 14 x 14 kilometer world of undulating horizons, craters, boulders and valleys. Its unsettling scale and bizarre shape are emphasized in this picture - a mosaic of images from the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft processed to yield a stereo anaglyphic view.  Along with dramatic chiaroscuro, NEAR's 3-D imaging provided important measurements of the asteroid's landforms and structures, and clues to the origin of this city-sized chunk of solar system. The smallest features visible here are about 30 meters across. After spending a year in orbit around Eros, the historic Near Shoemaker spacecraft made the first ever landing on an asteroid's surface February 12, 2001.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/stereoeros_near.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Stereo Eros","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/stereoeros_near.jpg"},{"date":"2003-03-02","explanation":"Start with the constellation of Orion.

Recent speculation now includes a pervasive growing field of mysterious repulsive energy that rips virtually everything apart.  Although the universe started with a Big Bang, analysis of recent cosmological measurements allows a possibility that it will end with a Big Rip.  As soon as few billion years from now, the controversial scenario holds, dark energy will grow to such a magnitude that our own Galaxy will no longer be able to hold itself together.  After that, stars, planets, and then even atoms might not be able to withstand the expansive internal force.  Previously, speculation on the ultimate fate of the universe centered on either a re-collapsing Big Crunch or a Big Chill.  Although the universe's fate is still a puzzle, piecing it together will likely follow from an increased understanding of the nature of dark matter and dark energy.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/puzzle_cook.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Will the Universe End in a Big Rip?","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0303/puzzle_cook_big.jpg"},{"date":"2003-03-04","explanation":"The center of the Lagoon Nebula is busy with the awesome spectacle of star formation.  Visible in the lower left, at least two long funnel-shaped clouds, each roughly half a light-year long, have been formed by extreme stellar winds and intense energetic starlight.  The tremendously bright nearby star, Hershel 36, lights the area.  Vast walls of dust hide and redden other hot young stars.  As energy from these stars pours into the cool dust and gas, large temperature differences in adjoining regions can be created generating shearing winds which may cause the funnels.

He reports that the picture is a good representation of the comet's visual appearance on that date and estimates the impressive tail to be five or six degrees long.

It is now widely recognized that sunlight does indeed produce a force which moves comet tails and a large, reflective sail could be a practical means of propelling a spacecraft. In fact, the illustration above represents one concept explored by NASA centers to develop an interstellar probe pushed along by sunlight reflected from an ultrathin sail. Nearly half a kilometer wide, the delicate solar sail would be unfurled in space. Continuous pressure from sunlight would ultimately accelerate the craft to speeds about five times higher than possible with conventional rockets -- without requiring any fuel!
