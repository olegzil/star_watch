IUE served as a geostationary orbiting observatory for the next 18 years acquiring over 100,000 observations with its onboard ultraviolet spectrographs. Its prodigious scientific output is only hinted at by the all-sky plot above which shows the locations of IUE's many pointed observations over its long operational history.

Instead, their presence is inferred by a long series of telescopic observations, tracking the star as it wiggles and wobbles in mutual gravitational response to the masses of its orbiting planets. Our own planetary system would be detectable by such a technique ... Using data obtained from frequent observations of this star over the last 50 years, University of Pitsburgh astronomer George Gatewood recently announced that much of Lalande 21185's wobble is most likely due to an unseen planet with approximately 90% of the mass of Jupiter and an orbital period of 5.8 years. His work also indicates that a second and possibly third planet of similar mass could well be present in the system. Massive planets orbiting a red dwarf star would be very different from the Earth -- as illustrated in this artist's vision of a Jupiter-sized planet with rings and moons lit by a cool, dim sun.

While probably\r formed at the same time as Io, the\r difference between the surfaces of these two moons of Jupiter\r could hardly be greater. Io's\r surface is young, shows practically no impact craters, and is\r continually being repaved by the lava\r exploding from its many large volcanoes.\r Callisto's\r surface is old, shows the highest density of impact craters in\r the Solar System, and harbors no\r volcanoes or even any large mountains. Callisto's\r surface is one large ice-field, laced with cracks and craters\r from billions of years of collisions with interplanetary debris.\r The high-resolution vertical band in the above mosaic\r was taken by the robot spacecraft Galileo\r currently orbiting Jupiter. The\r rest of the mosaic was compiled from pictures taken by the Voyager spacecraft\r which passed the Callisto\r in 1979.\r","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9612/callistofullface_gal_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Callisto Full Face\r\nCredit:","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9612/callistofullface_gal.jpg"},{"copyright":"MPAE","date":"1996-12-10","explanation":"Here is what a comet nucleus really looks\r like. For all active comets except Halley,\r it was only possible to see the surrounding opaque gas cloud called\r the coma. During Comet Halley's\r most recent pass through the inner Solar System\r in 1986, however, spacecraft Giotto\r was able to go right up to the comet and photograph its nucleus.\r The above image is a composite of hundreds of these photographs.\r Although the most famous comet, Halley\r achieved in 1986 only 1/10th the brightness that Comet Hyakutake\r did last year, and a similar comparison is likely with next year's\r pass of Comet Hale-Bopp. Every 76\r years Comet Halley comes around again,\r and each time the nucleus sheds about 6 meters of ice and rock\r into space. This debris composes Halley's tails\r and leaves an orbiting trail that, when falling to Earth,\r are called the Orionids Meteor Shower.\r","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9612/halley_hmc_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Comet Halley's Nucleus\r\nCredit:","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9612/halley_hmc.gif"},{"date":"1996-12-11","explanation":"Where do stars form?
