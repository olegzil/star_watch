According to the Holographic Principle, the most information you can get from this image is about 3 x 1065 bits for a normal sized computer monitor.  The Holographic Principle, yet unproven, states that there is a maximum amount of information content held by regions adjacent to any surface.  Therefore, counter-intuitively, the information content inside a room depends not on the volume of the room but on the area of the bounding walls.  The principle derives from the idea that the  Planck length, the length scale where quantum mechanics begins to dominate  classical gravity, is one side of an area that can hold only about one bit of information.  The limit was first postulated by physicist Gerard 't Hooft in 1993.  It can arise from generalizations from seemingly distant speculation that the information held by a black hole is determined not by its enclosed volume but by the surface area of its  event horizon.  The term \"holographic\" arises from a hologram analogy where three-dimension images are created by projecting light through a flat screen.

Evidently.  Meteor trains that twist noticeably are rare - and even more rarely photographed - but have been noted before.  The underlying reason for unusual meteor trains is that many meteors are markedly non-spherical in shape and non-uniform in composition.  Meteors, usually sand sized grains that originate in comets, will disintegrate as they enter the Earth's atmosphere.  Non-uniform meteors may evaporate more on one side than another.  This may cause a rotating meteor to wobble slightly in its path, and also to spray fast moving debris in a nearly spiral path.  The fast moving meteor debris ionizes molecules in the Earth's atmosphere that subsequently glow when they reacquire electrons.  Surely no meteor is perfectly uniform and spherical, so that a slight swagger that is below perceptibility is likely typical.

The Cassini observations are also consistent with the Dragon Storm being a long-lived storm, deep within the gas giant's atmosphere, that periodically flares-up to produce large, visible storm regions.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0502/dragonstorm_cassini_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Saturn's Dragon Storm","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0502/dragonstorm_cassini_c62.jpg"},{"copyright":"Peter WasilewskiGoddard Space Flight Center","date":"2005-02-26","explanation":"Scientific images of cosmic dust clouds or even frozen water can be esthetic too. In fact, this picture of thin layers of forming ice crystals uses a scientific understanding of light's wave properties solely for artistic purposes. Titled \"Illume\", the picture was created by astrophysicist Peter Wasilewski. To make the picture, the crystals were illuminated by light shining through a polarizing filter -- a filter that restricts the otherwise randomly oriented light waves to vibrate in only one direction. While passing through the ice, different colors of the polarized light are then refracted and reflected along slightly different paths by the delicate crystalline layers. Viewing the scene with a second polarizing filter brings out the wondrous display of structure and color. Painting with \"light, the laws of physics, and an attitude\" Wasilewski has created a series of these evocative ice images that he refers to as Frozen Vision or Frizion.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0502/illume_wasilewski_full.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Frizion Illume","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0502/illume_wasilewski_full.jpg"},{"copyright":"Nigel Sharp","date":"2005-02-27","explanation":"It is still not known why the Sun's light is missing some colors.  Shown above are all the visible colors of the  Sun, produced by passing the Sun's light through a prism-like device.  The above spectrum was created at the McMath-Pierce Solar Observatory and shows, first off, that although our yellow-appearing Sun emits light of nearly every color, it does indeed appear brightest in yellow-green light.  The dark patches in the above spectrum arise from gas at or above the Sun's surface absorbing sunlight emitted below.  Since different types of gas absorb different colors of light, it is possible to determine what gasses compose the Sun.  Helium, for example, was first discovered in 1870 on a solar spectrum and only later found here on Earth.  Today, the majority of spectral absorption lines have been identified - but not all.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/solarspectrum_noao.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Solar Spectrum","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/solarspectrum_noao.jpg"},{"date":"2005-02-28","explanation":"What are those unusual plates on Mars?  A leading current interpretation holds that they are blocks of ice floating on a recently frozen sea covered by dust.  The unusual plates were photographed recently by the European Space Agency's Mars Express spacecraft currently orbiting Mars.  Oddly, the region lies near the Martian equator and not near either of Mars' frozen polar caps.  Without being covered by dust, any water or ice near away from the poles would quickly evaporate right into the atmosphere.  Evidence that the above-imaged plates really are dust-covered water-ice includes a similarity in appearance to ice blocks off Earth's Antarctica, nearby surface fractures from which underground water could have flowed, and the shallow depth of the craters indicating that something is filling them in.  If correct, the low abundance of craters indicates that water may have flowed on Mars as recently as five million years ago.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0502/marsplates_express_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Unusual Plates on Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0502/marsplates_express.jpg"},{"copyright":"T.

NGC 1531 is the background galaxy with a bright core just above center and NGC 1532 is the foreground spiral galaxy laced with dust lanes.  The pair is about 55 million light-years away in the southern constellation Eridanus.  These galaxies lie close enough together so that each feels the influence of the other's gravity.  The gravitational tug-of-war has triggered star formation in the foreground spiral as evidenced by the young, bright blue star clusters along the upper edge of the front spiral arm.  Though the spiral galaxy in this pair is viewed nearly edge-on, astronomers believe the system is similar to the face-on spiral and companion known as M51, the Whirlpool Galaxy.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0503/ngc1532_gemini_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 1531/2: Interacting Galaxies","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0503/ngc1532_gemini.jpg"},{"date":"2005-03-02","explanation":"December's 9.0 earthquake has likely shortened Earth's day by about three microseconds and may also have tweaked Earth's rotational wobble.

Over 20,000 light-years long and similar to the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, NGC 1427A is speeding through the Fornax cluster's intergalactic gas at around 600 kilometers per second. The resulting pressure is giving the galaxy its arrowhead outline and triggering the beautiful but violent episodes of star formation. Still, it is understood that interactions with cluster gas and the other cluster galaxies during its headlong flight will ultimately disrupt galaxy NGC 1427A.

During partial lunar phases, the craters along the terminator are cast in dramatic relief by strong shadows.

This detailed close-up of the full Moon features two prominent ray craters, Copernicus (upper left) and Tycho (lower right), each with extensive ray systems of light colored debris blasted out by the crater-forming impacts. In general, ray craters are relatively young as their rays overlay the lunar terrain. In fact, at 85 kilometers wide, Tycho, with its far reaching rays, is the youngest large crater on the nearside. Crater Copernicus, surrounded by dark mare which contrast nicely with its bright rays, is 93 kilometers in diameter.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0503/moon8_mandel_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Tycho and Copernicus: Lunar Ray Craters","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0503/moon8_mandel.jpg"}]
