Second, the Earth's atmosphere blurs the light it lets through. The blurring is caused by varying density and continual motion of air. By orbiting above the Earth's atmosphere, the Hubble can get clearer images. In fact, even though HST has a mirror 15 times smaller than large Earth-bound telescopes, it can still resolve detail almost 100 times finer.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9703/hubble_sts82.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Hubble Floats Free \r\nCredit:","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9703/hubble_sts82.jpg"},{"date":"1997-03-07","explanation":"You no longer have to wake-up early to see Comet Hale-Bopp.\r From many northern locations, you can now go outside just after\r sunset and see Comet Hale-Bopp above the north-western horizon.\r Both writer/editors of APOD are\r impressed by how bright Comet Hale-Bopp\r has become, and how easily visible it is.

After computer processing to remove contributions from nearby objects and the effects of the earth's motion, they show \"spots\". These spots are the oldest, most distant structures known. They represent temperature variations in the early Universe. As our Universe expanded and cooled, conglomerations of mass formed. The COBE images confirm that only a million years after the big-bang - which occurred roughly 15 billion years ago - parts of the universe were visibly hotter than other parts. By studying the size and distribution of the spots found with COBE and future missions, astronomers hope to learn what matter and processes caused the spots to form - and hence determine the composition, density, and future of our Universe.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/4yr_cobe_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"COBE Hotspots: The Oldest Structures Known \n\nCredit:","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9703/4yr_cobe_big.gif"},{"date":"1997-03-10","explanation":"Jupiter's thick atmosphere is striped by wind-driven cloud bands that remain fixed in latitude - dark colored bands are known as belts while light colored bands are zones.

The resulting yellowish green appearance of the massive Jovian storm system - a cold, high pressure area 2 to 3 Earth diameters wide - indicates that it lies high above the surrounding cloud features.
