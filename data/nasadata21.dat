Many are images of a single, unusual, beaded, blue, ring-like galaxy which just happens to line-up behind a giant cluster of galaxies.  Cluster galaxies here appear yellow and -- together with the cluster's dark matter -- act as a gravitational lens.  A gravitational lens can create several images of background galaxies, analogous to the many points of light one would see while looking through a wine glass at a distant street light.  The distinctive shape of this background galaxy -- which is probably just forming -- has allowed astronomers to deduce that it has separate images at 4, 8, 9 and 10 o'clock, from the center of the cluster.

The Cartwheel Galaxy is part of a group of galaxies about 500 million light years away in the constellation Sculptor.   Two smaller galaxies in the group are visible on the left of the above photograph.  The Cartwheel's rim is an immense ring-like structure 100,000 light years in diameter composed of newly formed, extremely bright, massive stars.  When galaxies collide, they pass through each other -- their individual stars rarely come into contact.  The galaxies' gravitational fields, however, may be greatly distorted by the collision.  In fact, the ring-like shape is the result of the gravitational disruption caused by a small intruder galaxy passing through a large one, compressing the interstellar gas and dust, and causing a wave of star formation wave to move out from the impact point like a ripple across the surface of a pond.  In this case, the large galaxy may have originally been a spiral, not unlike our own Milky Way Galaxy, transformed by the collision.  Recent astronomical detective work has indicated what has become of the intruder.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/cartwheel_aao_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Cartwheel Galaxy","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/cartwheel_aao.jpg"},{"date":"2001-06-13","explanation":"Today's galaxy, M94 (NGC 4736), lies 15 million light-years away in the constellation Canes Venatici.

Along with other evidence, the comparison suggests that Pluto and Charon are closely related to Kuiper Belt worlds like 2001 KX76.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0108/2001kx76_eso_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"How Big Is 2001 KX76?","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0108/2001kx76_eso_a.jpg"},{"date":"2001-08-31","explanation":"Solar-powered, remotely piloted, and flying at about 25 miles per hour, NASA's Helios aircraft, is pictured above at 10,000 feet in skies northwest of Kauai, Hawaii on August 13. This ultralight propeller driven aircraft, essentially a flying wing with 14 electric engines, was built by AeroVironment Inc. Covered with solar cells, Helios' impressive 247 foot wide wing exceeds the wing span and even overall length of a Boeing 747 jet airliner. Climbing during daylight hours, the prototype aircraft ultimately reached an altitude just short of 100,000 feet, breaking records for non-rocket powered flight. Helios is intended as a technology demonstrator, but regular, long-duration flights at that altitude could be used for environmental monitoring missions and, communications relays. In the extremely thin air 100,000 feet above Earth's surface, the flight of Helios also simulates conditions for winged flight in the atmosphere of Mars.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0108/helios_cthomas_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Flight Of Helios","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0108/helios_cthomas.jpg"},{"date":"2001-09-01","explanation":"Indicated on this infrared image of the galactic center region are positions of candidate magnetars -- believed to be the strongest magnets in the galaxy. Classified by observers as Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs), these cosmic powerhouses are likely city-sized, spinning, highly-magnetized neutron stars. How strong is a magnetar's magnetic field? The Earth's magnetic field which deflects compass needles is measured to be about 1 Gauss, while the strongest fields sustainable in earthbound laboratories are about 100,000 Gauss. A magnetar's monster magnetic field is estimated to be as high as 1,000,000,000,000,000 Gauss. A magnet this strong, located at about half the distance to the Moon would easily erase your credit cards and suck pens out of your pocket. In 1998, from a distance of about 20,000 light-years, one magnetar, SGR 1900+14 generated a powerful flash of gamma-rays detected by many spacecraft. That blast of high-energy radiation is now known to have had a measurable effect on Earth's ionosphere. At the surface of the magnetar, its powerful magnetic field is thought to buckle and shift the neutron star crust generating the intense high-energy flares.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/magnetars_cobeloc_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Magnetars In The Sky","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/magnetars_cobeloc.jpg"},{"date":"2001-09-02","explanation":"Mars has two tiny moons, Phobos and Deimos.  Pictured above is Deimos, the smaller moon of Mars.  In fact, Deimos is one of the smallest known moons in the Solar System measuring only nine miles across.  The diminutive Martian moons were discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall, an American astronomer working at the US Naval Observatory in Washington D.C.  The existence of two Martian moons was predicted around 1610 by Johannes Kepler, the astronomer who derived the laws of planetary motion.  In this case, Kepler's prediction was not based on scientific principles, but his writings and ideas were so influential that the two Martian moons are discussed in works of fiction such as Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, written in 1726, over 150 years before their actual discovery.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/deimos_viking2_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Deimos: A Small Martian Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/deimos_viking2.jpg"},{"date":"2001-09-03","explanation":"Fast expanding gas clouds mark the end for a central star in the Rotten Egg Nebula.  The once-normal star has run out of nuclear fuel, causing the central regions to contract into a white dwarf.  Some of the liberated energy causes the outer envelope of the star to expand.  In this case, the result is a photogenic proto- planetary nebula.  As the million-kilometer per hour gas rams into the surrounding interstellar gas, a supersonic shock front forms where ionized hydrogen and nitrogen glow blue.  The complex shock front had been hypothesized previously but never so clearly imaged.  Thick gas and dust hide the dying central star.  The Rotten Egg Nebula, also known as the Calabash Nebula and OH231.8+4.2, will likely develop into a full bipolar planetary nebula over the next 1000 years.  The nebula, pictured above, is about 1.4 light-years in extent and located about 5000 light-years away toward the constellation of Puppis.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/rottenegg2_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Making of the Rotten Egg Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/rottenegg2_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2001-09-04","explanation":"How are galaxies distributed in the universe?  This question is of more than aesthetic interest because the answer likely holds clues to composition of the universe itself.  The above map shows the distribution of nearly 200,000 galaxies and is the latest answer obtained by one of the most complex astronomical instruments yet created: the Two-Degree Field (2dF) system.  The 2dF system measures galaxy redshifts, allowing astronomers to estimate distances to some of the millions of galaxies visible, and hence to make a three-dimensional map of the local universe.  Although the distribution of galaxies appears nearly uniform on the largest scale, waves of galaxies are discernable extending up to 100 million light-years.  Detailed analyses of the incoming data indicate that to create such a network of waves, normal baryonic matter must make up only 15 percent of all matter, while all matter must make up only about 30 percent of that needed to make the universe geometrically flat.  Is the remaining 70 percent dark energy?","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/galaxies_2dFGRS_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"2dF Sees Waves of Galaxies","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/galaxies_2dFGRS.jpg"},{"copyright":"Alan BridleNRAO CharlottesvilleVLANRAONSF","date":"2001-09-05","explanation":"3C175 is not only a quasar, it is a galaxy-fueled particle cannon.

The above image was recorded in radio waves by an array of house-sized telescopes called the Very Large Array (VLA).  Shooting out from 3C175 is a thin jet of protons and electrons traveling near the speed of light that is over one million light-years long.  The jet acts like a particle cannon and bores through gas cloud in its path.  How this jet forms and why it is so narrow remain topics of current research.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/3c175_vla_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"3C175: Quasar Cannon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/3c175_vla.jpg"},{"date":"2001-09-06","explanation":"Here's something you don't see too often ... a detailed picture of the full Moon surrounded by a rich field of background stars.  It's true that bright moonlight scattered by the atmosphere tends to mask faint stars, but pictures of the sunlit portion of the Moon made with earthbound telescopes or even with cameras on the lunar surface often fail to show any background stars at all. Why? Because the exposure times are too short. Very short exposures, lasting fractions of a second, are required to accurately record an image of the bright lunar surface. But the background stars (and galaxies!) such as those visible above are much fainter and need exposures lasting minutes to hours which would seriously overexpose the surface of the Moon. So, of course this stunning view really is a combination of two digital images -- a short exposure, registering the exquisite lunar surface details at full Moon, superposed on a separate very long exposure, made with the Moon absent from the star field. The final representation of Moon and background stars is very dramatic, even though it could not have been captured in a single exposure.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/moonstars_noao_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Moon AND Stars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/moonstars_noao.jpg"},{"date":"2001-09-07","explanation":"Today's composite image was made from 22 separate pictures of the Moon and Sun all taken from Chisamba, Zambia during the total phase of the 2001 June 21 solar eclipse.

Most striking are the incredible flowing streamers of the Sun's outer atmosphere or solar corona, notoriously difficult to see except when the new Moon blocks the bright solar disk. Features on the darkened near side of the Moon can also be made out, illuminated by sunlight reflected from a full Earth. A giant solar prominence seems to hang just beyond the Moon's eastern (left) edge while about one diameter farther east of the eclipsed Sun is the relatively faint (4th magnitude) star 1 Geminorum.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/tse2001cmp_espenak_c1.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Moon AND Sun","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0109/tse2001cmp_espenak_c1.jpg"},{"copyright":"K.

This animated gif image was constructed by Wes Colley from 4 frames taken by Stanek at 35 second intervals as the ringed planet emerged from behind the Moon's dark limb.
