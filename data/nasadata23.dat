While the optical image in reflected sunlight is filled and bright at the center, Venus in x-rays is bright around the edge. Venus' x-rays are produced by fluorescence rather than reflection. About 120 kilometers or so above the surface, incoming solar x-rays excite atoms in the Venusian atmosphere to unstable energy levels. As the atoms rapidly decay back to their stable ground states they emit a \"fluorescence\" x-ray, creating a glowing x-ray half-shell above the sunlit hemisphere.

The expended gas frequently forms an impressive display called a planetary nebula that fades gradually over thousand of years.  M2-9, a butterfly planetary nebula 2100 light-years away shown in representative colors, has wings that tell a strange but incomplete tale.

The inset shows an expanded view of one of the star-forming regions, about 300 light-years across. Indicated is the location of an extraordinarily powerful supernova explosion whose light first reached planet Earth on April 25, 1998. That location and date also correspond to the detection of an unusual gamma-ray burst, which may be representative of a peculiar class of these cosmic high-energy flashes. So far, this combination is unique and makes barred spiral ESO 184-G82, at a distance of only 100 million light-years, the closest known gamma-ray burst host galaxy.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0202/eso184-g82_c1.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"ESO 184-G82: Supernova - Gamma Ray Burst Connection","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0202/eso184-g82_c3.jpg"},{"date":"2002-03-01","explanation":"The Solar System's largest planet, gas giant Jupiter, is famous for its swirling Great Red Spot. In the right hand panel above, the familiar giant planet with storm system and cloud bands is shown in an optical image from the passing Cassini spacecraft. In the left hand panel, a false-color image from the orbiting Chandra Observatory presents a corresponding x-ray view of Jupiter. The Chandra image shows clearly, for the first time, x-ray spots and auroral x-ray emission from the poles. The x-ray spot dominating the emission from Jupiter's north pole (top) is perhaps as surprising for astronomers today as the Great Red Spot once was. Confounding previous theories, the x-ray spot is too far north to be associated with heavy electrically charged particles from the vicinity of volcanic moon Io. Chandra data also show that the spot's x-ray emission mysteriously pulsates over a period of about 45 minutes.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/xrayoptjup_comp.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Jupiter's Great X-Ray Spot","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/xrayoptjup_comp.jpg"},{"date":"2002-03-02","explanation":"While searching the skies above 18th century France for comets, astronomer Charles Messier diligently recorded this object as number 27 on his list of things which are definitely not comets. So what is it? Well, 20th century astronomers would classify it as a Planetary Nebula ... but it's not a planet either, even though it may appear round and planet-like in a small telescope. Messier 27 (M27) is now known to be an excellent example of a gaseous emission nebula created as a sun-like star runs out of nuclear fuel in its core. The nebula forms as the star's outer layers are expelled into space, with a visible glow generated by atoms excited by the dying star's intense but invisible ultraviolet light. Known by the popular name of the Dumbbell Nebula, the beautifully symmetric interstellar gas cloud is about 1,200 light-years away in the constellation Vulpecula. This gorgeous synthetic color picture of M27 was produced during testing of one of the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescopes.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/m27_vlt_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"M27: Not A Comet","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/m27_vlt.jpg"},{"date":"2002-03-03","explanation":"Tomorrow's picture: 5,000 horsepower  < | Archive | Index | Search | Calendar | Glossary | Education | About APOD | >  Authors & editors: Robert Nemiroff (MTU) & Jerry Bonnell (USRA) NASA Technical Rep.: Jay Norris.

Although the crawlers pack over 5,000 horsepower, their top speed is less than two kilometers per hour when fully loaded.  Eleven people are needed to drive a single crawler.  Diesel fuel mileage is about 350 liters per kilometer (less than 0.007 miles per gallon).  The crawler's function is to move NASA's space shuttles -- complete with launch platforms -- from the Assembly Building to the Launch Pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, USA.  Two of these massive machines have operated since the Apollo era and have now crawled over 4,000 kilometers, all the while keeping their contents perfectly upright. In this picture a crawler transports the shuttle Columbia to the pad prior to its March 1st launch on the latest Hubble Space Telelescope Servicing Mission.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/columbiacrawler_ksc_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Shuttle Crawler Transporter","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/columbiacrawler_ksc_c2.jpg"},{"date":"2002-03-05","explanation":"Here are the true colors of planet Earth.  Blue oceans dominate our world, while areas of green forest, brown mountains, tan desert, and white ice are also prominent.  Oceans appear blue not only because water itself is blue but also because seawater frequently scatters light from a blue sky.  Forests appear green because they contain chlorophyll, a pigment that preferentially absorbs red light.  The above image is a composite generated predominantly with data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), an instrument mounted on the Terra satellite that has orbited Earth since 1999 December.  Sub-areas were imaged only when experiencing cloud-free daylight when it occurred from June through September 2001.

A large, elliptical galaxy dominates this hypothetical cluster's central region surrounded by a swarm of member galaxies. Other galaxies which lie far behind the cluster are seen as numerous visible concentric arcs - lensed by the enormous gravitational field dominated by dark matter within the cluster itself. Such magnificent images are expected to be achieved by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), one of the upgrades being installed on the Hubble Space Telescope during the ongoing servicing mission. Compared to Hubble's workhorse Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2), whose achievements include the current deep field views of the Universe, the new technology ACS will be twice as sharp an imager with twice the field of view and five times the sensitivity.  Along with extended views of the distant cosmos, enthusiastic astronomers also plan to use the ACS to monitor our own Solar System and to search for planets orbiting stars beyond the Sun.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/simcluster_hubbleACS_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Simulated Galaxy Cluster View","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/simcluster_hubbleACS_c2.jpg"},{"copyright":"Gerald Rhemann","date":"2002-03-07","explanation":"In the last week, Comet Ikeya-Zhang has become bright enough to be just visible to the unaided eye. Based on its present activity, observers are optimistic that Ikeya-Zhang will become substantially brighter. This composite color image from March 3rd, captured with a wide-field telescope, shows this active comet's bright, condensed coma and a delightful array of subtle structures in its developing tail. The bluish tail stretches for 5 degrees or so against a background of stars in the constellation Pisces. In the coming days look for the comet hanging low in the western evening sky (below a bright yellowish Mars), eventually becoming difficult to see in the March twilight. But after April begins, Ikeya-Zhang will become a predawn object climbing higher into the morning sky as the month progresses. Cataloged as comet C/2002 C1, improved orbit determinations now make it seem very likely that Comet Ikeya-Zhang has been around here before. Refined calculations indicate this comet's last trip through the inner Solar System was 341 years ago, in 1661, when it was recorded as a bright comet.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/ikzhMarz3_rhemann_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Comet Ikeya-Zhang Brightens","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/ikzhMarz3_rhemann.jpg"},{"date":"2002-03-08","explanation":"Trailing a thick column of exhaust, the Space Shuttle Columbia blasted into the twilight morning sky on March 1, its thundering rockets briefly flooding a cloud bank with the light of a false dawn.

Columbia's crew is scheduled to complete the work today in the last of five space walks.

This gallery of quasar portraits from the Hubble Space Telescope offers a look at their local neighborhoods: the quasars themselves appear as the bright star-like objects with diffraction spikes. The images in the center and right hand columns reveal quasars associated with disrupted colliding and merging galaxies which should provide plenty of debris to feed a hungry black hole.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/qsohosts_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Quasar Portrait Gallery","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0203/qsohosts_hst.jpg"}]
