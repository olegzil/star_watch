Pictured above are not aurora but nearby light pillars, a local phenomenon that can appear as a distant one.  In most places on Earth, a lucky viewer can see a Sun-pillar, a column of light appearing to extend up from the Sun caused by flat fluttering ice-crystals reflecting sunlight from the upper atmosphere.  Usually these ice ice crystals evaporate before reaching the ground.  During freezing temperatures, however, flat fluttering ice crystals may form near the ground in a form of light snow, sometimes known as a crystal fog.

Recently, the orbiting robotic GRACE satellite has been taking sensitive measurements of the gravity for the entire Earth, including Antarctica.  Recent analysis of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data indicate that the Antarctic ice sheet might have lost enough mass to cause the worlds' oceans to rise about 1.2 millimeters, on the average, from between 2002 and 2005.   Although this may not seem like much, the equivalent amount of water is about 150 trillion liters, equivalent to the amount of water used by US residents in three months.  Uncertainties in the measurement make the mass loss uncertain by about 80 trillion liters.  Pictured above is an iceberg that is a small part of the Antarctic ice sheet.

About 2,100 light-years away and 3 light-years across, NGC 1579 is a captivating study in color. Like the Trifid, NGC 1579 is a dusty star forming region providing contrasting emission and reflection nebulae in the same field - the characteristic red glow of hydrogen gas and the blue of reflected starlight. Also like the Trifid, dark dust lanes are prominent in the nebula's central regions. In fact, obscuring dust is pervasive in NGC 1579, drastically dimming the visible light from the massive, young, hot stars still embedded in the cosmic cloud.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0605/ngc1579_gabany_lc.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"NGC 1579: Trifid of the North","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0605/ngc1579_gabany_c55.jpg"},{"copyright":"Steve Crouch","date":"2006-05-26","explanation":"Centaurus, the Centaur, is one of the most striking constellations in the southern sky. The Milky Way flows through this celestial expanse whose wonders also include the closest star to the Sun, Alpha Centauri, and the largest globular star cluster in our galaxy, Omega Centauri. This gorgeous wide-field telescopic view of Omega Centauri shows off the cluster of about 10 million stars and the surrounding star field, with very faint dust clouds and distant background galaxies. Omega Cen itself is about 15,000 light-years away and 150 light-years in diameter - one of 150 or so known globular star clusters that roam the halo of our galaxy.

The startling notion is demonstrated by this image of the Moon from the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) in orbit on NASA's Compton Gamma Ray Observatory from April 1991 to June 2000. Then, the most sensitive instrument of its kind, even EGRET could not see the quiet Sun which is extremely faint at gamma-ray energies. So why is the Moon bright? High energy charged particles, known as cosmic rays, constantly bombard the unprotected lunar surface generating gamma-ray photons. EGRET's gamma-ray vision was not sharp enough to resolve a lunar disk or any surface features, but its sensitivity reveals the induced gamma-ray moonglow. So far unique, the image was generated from eight exposures made during 1991-1994 and covers a roughly 40 degree wide field of view with gamma-ray intensity represented in false color.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0605/moon_egret_150c.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Gamma-Ray Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0605/moon_egret_150c.jpg"},{"date":"2006-05-28","explanation":"In the center of a swirling whirlpool of hot gas is likely a beast that has never been seen directly: a black hole.  Studies of the bright light emitted by the swirling gas frequently indicate not only that a black hole is present, but also likely attributes.  The gas surrounding GRO J1655-40, for example, has been found to display an unusual flickering at a rate of 450 times a second.  Given a previous mass estimate for the central object of seven times the mass of our Sun, the rate of the  fast flickering can be explained by a black hole that is rotating very rapidly.  What physical mechanisms actually cause the flickering -- and a slower quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) -- in  accretion disks surrounding black holes and neutron stars remains a topic of much research.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0605/blackholestorm_chandra_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"GRO J1655-40: Evidence for a Spinning Black Hole","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0605/blackholestorm_chandra.jpg"},{"date":"2006-05-29","explanation":"Do you ever feel like watching the NASA channel?

Estimated as changing little in the past billion years, Rhea shows craters so old they no longer appear round \ufffd their edges have become compromised by more recent cratering.   Like Earth's Moon, Rhea's rotation is locked on Saturn, and the above image shows part of Rhea's surface that always faces Saturn.  Rhea's leading surface is more highly cratered than its trailing surface.   Rhea is composed mostly of water-ice but is thought to have a small rocky core.  The above image was taken by the robot Cassini spacecraft now orbiting Saturn.   Cassini swooped past Rhea two months ago and captured the above image from about 100,000 kilometers away.  Rhea spans 1,500 kilometers making it Saturn's second largest moon after Titan.  Several surface features on Rhea remain unexplained including large light patches.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0605/rhea3_cassini_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Ancient Craters on Saturn's Rhea","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0605/rhea3_cassini.jpg"},{"date":"2006-05-31","explanation":"Scheduled for launch in 2007, the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) will explore the Universe in gamma-rays, the most energetic form of light.

The all-sky view is projected in an astronomical (RA-Dec) coordinate system that shows the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy as a broad U-shape, with the center of the galaxy toward the right. So what shines in this gamma-ray sky? Besides the diffuse Milky Way glow, astronomers testing their skills on the simulated data have found flaring active galaxies, pulsars, gamma-ray bursts, the flaring Sun, and of course, the gamma-ray Moon.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0605/mv1ct4.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Simulated Gamma-ray Sky","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0605/mv1ct4.gif"},{"copyright":"Robert GendlerMartin Pugh","date":"2006-06-01","explanation":"NGC 6188 is an interstellar carnival of young blue stars, hot red gas, and cool dark dust.  Located 4,000 light years away in the disk of our Galaxy,  NGC 6188 is home to the Ara OB1 association, a group of bright young stars whose nucleus forms the open cluster NGC 6193.  These stars are so bright that some of their blue light reflects off of interstellar dust forming the diffuse blue glow surrounding the stars in the above photograph.  Open cluster NGC 6193 formed about three million years ago from the surrounding gas, and appears unusually rich in close binary stars.   The red glow visible throughout the photograph arises from hydrogen gas heated by the bright stars in Ara OB1.  The dark dust that blocks much of NGC 6188's light was likely formed in the outer atmospheres of cooler stars and in supernovae ejecta.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0606/ngc6188_gendler_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Reflections on NGC 6188","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0606/ngc6188_gendler.jpg"},{"date":"2006-06-02","explanation":"IC 443 is typical of the aftermath of a stellar explosion, the ultimate fate of massive stars. Seen in this false-color composite image, the supernova remnant is still glowing across the spectrum, from radio (blue) to optical (red) to x-ray (green) energies -- even though light from the stellar explosion that created the expanding cosmic cloud first reached planet Earth thousands of years ago. The odd thing about IC 443 is the apparent motion of its dense neutron star, the collapsed remnant of the stellar core. The close-up inset shows the swept-back wake created as the neutron star hurtles through the hot gas, but that direction is not aligned with the direction toward the apparent center of the remnant. The misalignment suggests that the explosion site was offset from the center or that fast-moving gas in the nebula has influenced the wake. The wide view of IC 443, also known as the Jellyfish nebula, spans about 65 light-years at the supernova remnant's estimated distance of 5,000 light-years.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0606/ic443_comp_f.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"IC 443: Supernova Remnant and Neutron Star","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0606/ic443_comp_f85.jpg"},{"date":"2006-06-03","explanation":"The pixelated planet above is actually our own planet Earth seen in gamma rays - the most energetic form of light. In fact, the gamma rays used to construct this view pack over 35 million electron volts (MeV) compared to a mere two electron volts (eV) for a typical visible light photon. The Earth's gamma-ray glow is indeed very faint, and this image was constructed by combining data from seven years of exposure during the life of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, operating in Earth orbit from 1991 to 2000. Brightest near the edge and faint near the center, the picture indicates that the gamma rays are coming from high in Earth's atmosphere. The gamma rays are produced as the atmosphere interacts with high energy cosmic rays from space, blocking the harmful radiation from reaching the surface.  Astronomers need to understand Earth's gamma-ray glow well as it can interfere with observations of cosmic gamma-ray sources like pulsars, supernova remnants, and distant active galaxies powered by supermassive black holes.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0606/grayEarth_petry.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Gamma-Ray Earth","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0606/grayEarth_petry.jpg"}]
