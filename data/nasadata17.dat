Sirius is visible on the far left of the above photograph, to the left of the constellation of Orion and Comet Hale-Bopp.  Intrinsically, Sirius is over 20 times brighter than our Sun and over twice as massive.  As Sirius is 8.7 light years distant, it is not the closest star system - the Alpha Centauri system holds this distinction.  Sirius is called the Dog Star because of its prominence in the constellation of Canis Majoris (Big Dog).  In 1862, Sirius was discovered to be a binary star system with a companion star, Sirius B, 10,000 times dimmer than the bright primary, Sirius A.  Sirius B was the first white dwarf star discovered, a type of star first understood by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1930.  While studying Sirius in 1718, Edmond Halley discovered that stars move with respect to each other.  There is conflicting evidence that Sirius appeared more red only 2000 years ago.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/siriushb_jcc_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Sirius: The Brightest Star in the Night","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/siriushb_jcc.jpg"},{"date":"2000-06-12","explanation":"What's happening in the center of this galaxy?  Close inspection of the center of NGC 4438, as visible in this recently released representative-color image by the Hubble Space Telescope, reveals an unusual bubble of hot gas, colored in red.  Astronomers speculate that this strange bubble was created by a massive central black hole that resides there.  As gas swirls around the black hole, gravity and friction pull it in and heat it up.  Some of the hot gas then falls into the black hole, but not all - some gas gets so hot it shoots out the poles in fast jets.  When these jets impact nearby material, they heat it up and cause the detected glow.  Galaxy NGC 4438 resides about 50 million light years from Earth, and the pictured central bubble measures about 800 light-years across.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/bhbubble_hst_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"A Bubbling Galaxy Center","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/bhbubble_hst.jpg"},{"date":"2000-06-13","explanation":"About three million years ago, the stars in the Keyhole Nebula began to form.

Formed from the primordial stuff of the solar system, it is thought to resemble a very dirty iceberg. But for active comets, telescopic images only reveal the surrounding cloud of gas and dust, the comet's coma, and the characteristic cometary tails. In 1986, the European spacecraft Giotto encountered the nucleus of Halley's comet as it approached the sun. Data from Giotto's camera was used to generate this enhanced image of the potato shaped nucleus which measures roughly 15 kilometers across. It shows surface features on the dark nucleus against the bright background of the coma as the icy material is vaporized by the Sun's heat. Every 76 years Comet Halley returns to the inner solar system and each time the nucleus sheds about a 6 meter deep layer of its ice and rock into space. This debris composes Halley's tails and leaves an orbiting trail responsible for the Orionids meteor shower.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/halleynuc_giotto_big.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Halley's Nucleus: An Orbiting Iceberg","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/halleynuc_giotto.jpg"},{"copyright":"O.

Since then astronomers had been searching in vain to find any fragments left of the nucleus, and watching to see how fast the remaining debris fades.  Just three days ago the Hubble Space Telescope was maneuvered to photograph the region and recovered some of the disintegrating fragments that used to compose Comet LINEAR's nucleus.  The above image covers only the very tip of an elongated diffuse train of slowly dispersing gas, dust, ice fragments, and gravel.

Shining in Earth's night sky at 6th magnitude, this sun-like star lies 137 light-years away in the constellation Orion. Like most of the known extrasolar planets, HD38529's planet was discovered by detecting the telltale Doppler wobble in the parent star's spectrum. The data reveal that this planet orbits once every 14.3 days at an average of only 0.13 times the Earth-Sun distance and has a minimum of 0.77 Jupiter masses (about 240 Earth masses).

It was recorded by astronomers using the European Southern Observatory's Antu telescope about a day after the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) was also able to image the covey of condensations. A comparison of the HST and the subsequent Antu images reveals that the swarm of cometary debris has changed markedly in 24 hours demonstrating the very dynamic behavior of comet LINEAR's remains. Astronomers intend to keep watching as comet LINEAR's fragments continue to lose dust and gas and fade from view.

Deep Space 1 is seen here suspended in an assembly room, a folded solar array resting above the circular ion propulsion module. Already a successful technology demonstrator with experimental autonomous software, the spacecraft flew by asteroid 9969 Braille in July of 1999 but later that year, in November, the robot probe was nearly lost due to the failure of its wide-field star tracker camera. Now, the adventures of Deep Space 1 can continue. Engineers were able to reprogram the navigation system to utilize another on-board camera and on 28 June 2000 the ion drive was throttled up. Once again steering by the stars, Deep Space 1 is presently bound for a September 2001 rendezvous with periodic Comet Borrelly.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/ds1_jpl_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Full Throttle For Deep Space 1","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0008/ds1_jpl.jpg"},{"date":"2000-09-01","explanation":"SOHO, the space-based SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory, has become by far the reigning champion facility for discovering comets, its total having recently reached 200. As might be expected of a solar observatory, most of the SOHO discovered comets are sungrazers, destined to dive within a mere 50 thousand kilometers or so of the solar photosphere. At that range the intense heat and gravitational forces make it unlikely these primitive chunks of ice and dust will survive. Based on their similar orbits, as first worked out by 19th century German astronomer Heinrich Kreutz, all sungrazers are believed to originate from a single large parent comet which broke up during a perihelion passage perhaps 2,000 years ago. Over time, pieces have continued to split off producing a family of smaller comets which seem to travel in the same orbit. These frames from SOHO's coronograph were taken two hours apart on April 29 of this year. They show a sungrazer (SOHO comet discovery number 111) with a long, bright tail headed toward its fiery encounter. The sun itself is hidden behind the coronograph's occulting disk at each frame's upper right.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0009/slasc2_20000429_2154.gif","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"SOHO Sungrazer","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0009/sohocomet_20000429_2154.jpg"},{"date":"2000-09-02","explanation":"This x-ray image of the Moon was made by the orbiting ROSAT (R\u00f6ntgensatellit) Observatory in 1990. In this digital picture, pixel brightness corresponds to x-ray intensity. Consider the image in three parts: the bright hemisphere of the x-ray moon, the darker half of the moon, and the x-ray sky background. The bright lunar hemisphere shines in x-rays because it reflects x-rays emitted by the sun ... just as it shines at night by reflecting visible sunlight. The background sky has an x-ray glow in part due to the myriad of distant, powerful active galaxies, unresolved in the ROSAT picture but recently detected in Chandra Observatory x-ray images. But why isn't the dark half of the moon completely dark? It's true that the dark lunar face is in shadow and so is not reflecting solar x-rays. Still, the few x-ray photons which seem to come from the moon's dark half are currently thought to be caused by energetic particles in the solar wind bombarding the lunar surface.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0009/rosat_moon_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"X-Ray Moon","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0009/rosat_moon.jpg"},{"date":"2000-09-03","explanation":"Humanity's understanding of the relative brightness and variability of stars was revolutionized by the work of Henrietta Swan Leavitt (1868-1921).  Working at Harvard College Observatory, Leavitt precisely calibrated the photographic magnitudes of 47 stars to which all other stars could be compared.  Leavitt discovered and cataloged over 1500 variable stars in the nearby Magellanic Clouds.  From this catalog, Leavitt discovered that brighter Cepheid variable stars take longer to vary, a fact used today to calibrate the distance scale of our universe.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0009/leavitt_aavso_sml.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Henrietta Leavitt Calibrates the Stars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0009/leavitt_aavso.jpg"},{"copyright":"Brent Price","date":"2000-09-04","explanation":"Last month, skywatchers were treated to an unexpected coincidence: bright aurorae occurred during the Perseid Meteor Shower.

Aurorae are becoming increasingly common as their trigger -- our Sun -- nears its period of highest activity during its eleven-year magnetic cycle.  Coming up in mid-November is the quirky Leonids Meteor Shower.

Unlike a human eye, which collects light for only a fraction of a second at a time, a telescope such as the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) can collect light for hours. Faint sources become visible that were previously beyond human imagination.  These meticulous observations usually take so long, though, that the Earth's spin causes the telescope to move under the sky.  This spin is visible in the above photograph as star trails in the background.  The CFHT itself must counter-spin to keep on target.  The enormous size of the CFHT dome can be gauged by the car in the foreground.

Dubbed the Spirograph Nebula for its resemblance to drawings from a cyclical drawing tool, planetary nebula IC 418 shows patterns that are not well understood.  Perhaps they are related to chaotic winds from the variable central star, which changes brightness unpredictably in just a few hours.  By contrast, evidence indicates that only a few million years ago, IC 418 was probably a well-understood star similar to our Sun.  Only a few thousand years ago, IC 418 was probably a common red giant star.  Since running out of nuclear fuel, though, the outer envelope has begun expanding outward leaving a hot remnant core destined to become a white-dwarf star, visible in the image center.  The light from the central core excites surrounding atoms in the nebula causing them to glow.  IC 418 lies about 2000 light-years away and spans 0.3 light-years across.  This recently released false-color image taken from the Hubble Space Telescope reveals the unusual details.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0009/spirograph_heritage_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"IC 418: The Spirograph Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0009/spirograph_heritage.jpg"},{"copyright":"Robert Gendler","date":"2000-09-08","explanation":"How far can you see? The most distant object easily visible to the unaided eye is M31, the great Andromeda Galaxy some two million light-years away.

But a bright yellow nucleus, dark winding dustlanes, gorgeous blue spiral arms and star clusters are recorded in this stunning telescopic digital mosaic of the nearby island universe. While even casual skygazers are now inspired by the knowledge that there are many distant galaxies like M31, astronomers seriously debated this fundamental concept only 80 years ago. Were these \"spiral nebulae\" simply outlying components of our own Milky Way Galaxy or were they instead \"island universes\" -- distant systems of stars comparable to the Milky Way itself? This question was central to the famous Shapley-Curtis debate of 1920, which was later resolved by observations of M31 in favor of Andromeda, island universe.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0009/m31_gendler_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Andromeda Island Universe","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0009/m31_gendler.jpg"},{"date":"2000-09-09","explanation":"An x-ray star winks out behind the Moon in these before (left) and after views of a lunar occultation of the galactic x-ray source designated GX5-1.
